<p>
This rule template can be used to create rules which will be triggered when a comment matches a given regular expression.
For example, one can create a rule with the regular expression ".*TODO.*" to match all comment containing "TODO".

<p>
Note that, in order to match TODO regardless of the case, the "(?i)" modifier can be prepended to the expression, as in "(?i).*TODO.*".
