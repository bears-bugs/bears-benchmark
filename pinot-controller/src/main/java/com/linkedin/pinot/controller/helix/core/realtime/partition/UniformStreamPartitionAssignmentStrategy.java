/**
 * Generates a uniform partition assignment for the table
 * The partition assignment is done by uniformly spraying the partitions across available instances
 * A random point is picked as the start for the spreading out over instances
 *
 * This strategy does not care about what are the other tables on the tenant,
 * and only assigns partitions for the one table that is being added/updated
 *
 * NOTE: We do not support/expect partition aware tables with multi tenant setup, hence this strategy should suffice
 *
 * An example znode for 8 kafka partitions and and 6 realtime servers (Server_s1 to Server_s6)
 * for a table config with UniformStreamPartitionAssignmentStrategy looks as below in zookeeper.
 * This example assumes that the random point picked was at the first server i.e. Server_s1.company.com
