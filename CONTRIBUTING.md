  noticed a *bug* in the framework, any feedback is a valuable contribution.

* **Documentation** - Any improvements or additions you may have to the documentation found on these
  pages are very welcome.

## Pull Requests


The easiest way to contribute code or documentation is to send us a pull request on GitHub. Please
follow these steps:

2. Create a fork of the FRESCO repository.

3. Make your changes to the new fork.

Before being merged into the project your pull request will be reviewed by the FRESCO team. To ease

please give the pull request an informative title and description, preferably with references to the
issues related to the request (see
