bugs:
category members not immutable
no getters from setters
translate to E may change parameters, see test: is instance
review types: document, method as parameters
date/time/ check return type
compiled for each/inner switch

missing code:
python timezone name
javascript timezone name
check return types
check member methods
check assign item
check assign member
return sorted sets 
implement dbIdListener strategy (store, ConcreteInstance... )
method as attribute
attribute as type
attribute as variable: parameter
attribute as attribute
move MIN_INT && MAX_INT to enum
factor compileAssert
make id a global native method or implement it for all types
save StackLocals between closure definition and instantiation
list/set from cursor/iterator
SOLR queryAndStreamResponse

issues:
invokedynamic parameter names/order
test/asserts naming of parameters
toJson needs an Avro like output to be readable

missing tests:
null member is empty
pass/empty statement
tuple equals tuple
a = null, null = a
slice tuple
return in loops, if/else and with singleton
category abstract operator methods
decimal * category
delete/store
store mutable child
iterating over enumerated category symbols for name/value/other
iterating over enumerated native symbols for name/value/other

language:
send/receive
sentence/verb
method as attribute, AnyMethod
pattern literals
typed tuples?
uuid literal

runtime:
shared versioned singletons

framework:
json
xml
threads
receive/send
timer/scheduler
type category
avro
protobuf
logging
