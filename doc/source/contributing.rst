Contributing
============

We will be happy to accept contributions to the FRESCO framework. Contributions could include:

* **Feedback** - Whether you have a *question* on FRESCO, a *suggestion* for new additions or
  noticed a *bug* in the framework, any feedback is a valuable contribution.

* **Documentation** - Any improvements or additions you may have to the documentation found on these
  pages are very welcome. For more on how to work on the
  documentation, see :ref:`here<documentation>`.

* **Code** - We will be very happy to include well-written code that is compliant with the overall
  FRESCO design. This could be bug fixes, new protocol suites, generic functionality fitting the
  FRESCO standard library or improvements to the core framework etc. For more on how to work with
  the FRESCO code see :ref:`here<developers>`.

We encourage you to use our `issue tracker`_ to provide
feedback or discuss any other contributions you would like to make. Alternatively, you can contact
