Demos
=====

This folder contains various demonstrators which can be used to build and run
FRESCO applications. Each demonstrator will create a runnable jar and running
them is eased with the use of Makefiles.

Additionally unit tests in each application tests the application itself for
all demonstrators.

The demonstrators serve as a showcase of how easy it is to create and run a MPC
application. Application developers can use these as starting points for more
advanced application building.

Currently demonstrators are available for the following functionalities:

* Sum
* Distance
* Aggregation over (key, value) pairs
* Private Set Intersection (PSI)
* AES
