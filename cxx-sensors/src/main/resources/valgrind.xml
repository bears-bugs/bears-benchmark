    <key>InvalidFree</key>

    <description>
      Calling free with the given address is illegal. This usually means
      that the block is already freed or that the block has never been
      allocated on the heap.

      Wrong deallocation function used to deallocate an allocated
      block. C++ rules are:
      - deallocate with 'free' when allocated with 'malloc', 'calloc',
      'realloc', 'valloc' or 'memalign'
      - deallocate with 'delete' when allocated with 'new'
      - deallocate with 'delete []' when allocated with 'new []'

    <name>Memory leak (definitely lost)</name>
    <description>
      Memory block which was unfreed at programs exit and for which
      no pointer pointing at it could be found.  Such blocks are
      classified as "lost", because the programmer could not possibly have
      freed it at program exit, since no pointer to it exists. This is
      likely a symptom of having lost the pointer at some earlier point in
      the program. Such cases should be fixed by the programmer.

    <name>Memory leak (indirectly lost)</name>
    <description>
      This means that the block is lost, not because there are no
      pointers to it, but rather because all the blocks that point to it are
      themselves lost. For example, if you have a binary tree and the root
      node is lost, all its children nodes will be indirectly lost.

    <description>
      This means that a chain of one or more pointers to a block
      has been found, but at least one of the pointers is an
      interior-pointer. This could just be a random value in memory that
      happens to point into a block, and so you shouldn't consider this OK
      unless you know you have interior-pointers.

    <description>
      Blocks of memory which weren't lost (pointers pointing to them existed)
      but also weren't freed at process' exit. Since the block are pointed at,
      the programmer could, at least in principle, have freed it before
      the exit.
