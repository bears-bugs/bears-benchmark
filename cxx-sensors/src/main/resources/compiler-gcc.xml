    <description>
    Warn when G++ generates code that is probably not compatible with the vendor-neutral
    C++ ABI. Although an effort has been made to warn about all such cases, there are probably some
    cases that are not warned about, even though G++ is generating incompatible code. There may also
    be cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated will be compatible.

    You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are concerned about the fact that code
    generated by G++ may not be binary compatible with code generated by other compilers.

    <description>
    Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using the address of
    a function in a conditional expression, such as "void func(void); if (func)", and comparisons
    against the memory address of a string literal, such as "if (x == "abc")". Such uses typically
    indicate a programmer error: the address of a function always evaluates to true, so their use in
    a conditional usually indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function call;
    and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified behavior and are not portable in C,
    so they usually indicate that the programmer intended to use "strcmp".

    <key>-Walloca-larger-than</key>
    <name>Warn on calls to alloca that are not bounded by a controlling predicate</name>
    <description>
    This option warns on calls to alloca that are not bounded by a controlling predicate limiting its
    argument of integer type to at most n bytes, or calls to alloca where the bound is unknown. Arguments
    of non-integer types are considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to the expected
    range.

    For example, a bounded case of alloca could be:

    void func (size_t n)
    {
      void *p;
      if (n &lt;= 1000)
        p = alloca (n);
      else
        p = malloc (n);
      f (p);
    }

    In the above example, passing -Walloca-larger-than=1000 would not issue a warning because the call to
    alloca is known to be at most 1000 bytes. However, if -Walloca-larger-than=500 were passed, the
    compiler would emit a warning.

    Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of alloca with no controlling predicate constraining its
    integer argument. For example:

    void func ()
    {
      void *p = alloca (n);
      f (p);
    }

    If -Walloca-larger-than=500 were passed, the above would trigger a warning, but this time because of
    the lack of bounds checking.

    Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could cause a warning:

    void func (signed int n)
    {
      if (n &lt; 500)
        {
          p = alloca (n);
          f (p);
        }
    }

    In the above example, n could be negative, causing a larger than expected argument to be implicitly cast
    into the alloca call.

    This option also warns when alloca is used in a loop.

    This warning is not enabled by -Wall, and is only active when -ftree-vrp is active (default for -O2 and above).

    See also -Wvla-larger-than=n.

    For C++, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined conversions; and conversions
    that will never use a type conversion operator: conversions to "void", the same type, a base class
    or a reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and unsigned integers are
    disabled by default in C++ unless -Wsign-conversion is explicitly enabled.

    <description>
    Warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which if statement an else branch
    belongs. Here is an example of such a case:

    {
      if (a)
        if (b)
          foo ();
      else
        bar ();
    }

    In C/C++, every else branch belongs to the innermost possible if statement, which in this
    example is if (b). This is often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the
    above example by indentation the programmer chose. When there is the potential for this
    confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag is specified. To eliminate the warning, add
    explicit braces around the innermost if statement so there is no way the else can belong
    to the enclosing if. The resulting code looks like this:

    {
      if (a)
        {
          if (b)
            foo ();
          else
            bar ();
        }
    }

    This warning is enabled by -Wparentheses.

    Give a warning when a value of type "float" is implicitly promoted to "double". CPUs
    with a 32-bit "single-precision" floating-point unit implement "float" in hardware, but emulate
    "double" in software. On such a machine, doing computations using "double" values is much more
    expensive because of the overhead required for software emulation.

    It is easy to accidentally do computations with "double" because floating-point literals are
    implicitly of type "double". For example, in:

            float area(float radius)
            {
               return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
            }

    the compiler will perform the entire computation with "double" because the floating-point literal
    is a "double".

    Warn if floating point values are used in equality comparisons.

    The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider
    floating-point values as approximations to infinitely precise real numbers. If you are doing this,
    then you need to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or likely
    maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it when performing comparisons (and
    when producing output, but that's a different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for
    equality, you would check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and this is done
    with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are probably mistaken.

    attributes, in the "printf", "scanf", "strftime" and "strfmon" (an X/Open extension, not in the C
    standard) families (or other target-specific families). Which functions are checked without format
    attributes having been specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
    functions without the attribute specified are disabled by -ffreestanding or -fno-builtin.

    The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU libc version 2.2. These

    some BSD and GNU extensions. Other library implementations may not support all these features;
    GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a particular library's limitations.
    However, if -pedantic is used with -Wformat, warnings will be given about format features not in
    the selected standard version (but not for "strfmon" formats, since those are not in any version
    of the C standard).

    <name>Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions that might overflow the destination buffer</name>
    <description>
    Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as sprintf and vsprintf
    that might overflow the destination buffer. When the exact number of bytes written
    by a format directive cannot be determined at compile-time it is estimated based
    on heuristics that depend on the level argument and on optimization. While enabling
    optimization will in most cases improve the accuracy of the warning, it may also
    result in false positives.

    -Wformat-overflow
    -Wformat-overflow=1

    Level 1 of -Wformat-overflow enabled by -Wformat employs a conservative approach that
    warns only about calls that most likely overflow the buffer. At this level, numeric
    arguments to format directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of
    one, and strings of unknown length to be empty. Numeric arguments that are known to
    be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output is bounded
    either by their directive‚Äôs precision or by a finite set of string literals, are
    assumed to take on the value within the range that results in the most bytes on
    output. For example, the call to sprintf below is diagnosed because even with both
    a and b equal to zero, the terminating NUL character ('\0') appended by the function
    to the destination buffer will be written past its end. Increasing the size of the
    buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the warning, though it may not be
    sufficient to avoid the overflow.

    void f (int a, int b)
    {
      char buf [12];
      sprintf (buf, "a = %i, b = %i\n", a, b);
    }

    -Wformat-overflow=2

    Level 2 warns also about calls that might overflow the destination buffer given an
    argument of sufficient length or magnitude. At level 2, unknown numeric arguments are
    assumed to have the minimum representable value for signed types with a precision
    greater than 1, and the maximum representable value otherwise. Unknown string
    arguments whose length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive‚Äôs
    precision, or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the
    character array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.

    At level 2, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but this time because
    with a equal to a 32-bit INT_MIN the first %i directive will write some of its digits
    beyond the end of the destination buffer. To make the call safe regardless of the
    values of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased to
    at least 34 bytes. GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer in an informational
    note following the warning.

    An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to constrain the
    range of formatted values. The maximum length of string arguments can be bounded by
    specifying the precision in the format directive. When numeric arguments of format
    directives can be assumed to be bounded by less than the precision of their type,
    choosing an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce the
    required buffer size. For example, if a and b in the example above can be assumed to
    be within the precision of the short int type then using either the %hi format
    directive or casting the argument to short reduces the maximum required size of the
    buffer to 24 bytes.

    void f (int a, int b)
    {
      char buf [23];
      sprintf (buf, "a = %hi, b = %i\n", a, (short)b);
    }

    Warn about uses of format functions that represent possible security problems. At
    present, this warns about calls to "printf" and "scanf" functions where the format string is not
    a string literal and there are no format arguments, as in "printf (foo);". This may be a security
    hole if the format string came from untrusted input and contains %n.

    <description>
    Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as snprintf and vsnprintf that might
    result in output truncation. When the exact number of bytes written by a format directive
    cannot be determined at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the
    level argument and on optimization. While enabling optimization will in most cases improve the
    accuracy of the warning, it may also result in false positives. Except as noted otherwise, the
    option uses the same logic -Wformat-overflow.

    -Wformat-truncation
    -Wformat-truncation=1

    Level 1 of -Wformat-truncation enabled by -Wformat employs a conservative approach that warns
    only about calls to bounded functions whose return value is unused and that will most likely
    result in output truncation.

    -Wformat-truncation=2

    Level 2 warns also about calls to bounded functions whose return value is used and that might
    result in truncation given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.

    <key>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</key>
    <name>Warn when a switch case falls through</name>
    <description>
    Warn when a switch case falls through. For example:

    switch (cond)
      {
      case 1:
        a = 1;
        break;
      case 2:
        a = 2;
      case 3:
        a = 3;
        break;
      }

    This warning does not warn when the last statement of a case cannot fall through, e.g.
    when there is a return statement or a call to function declared with the noreturn
    attribute. -Wimplicit-fallthrough= also takes into account control flow statements,
    such as ifs, and only warns when appropriate. E.g.

    switch (cond)
      {
      case 1:
        if (i &gt; 3) {
          bar (5);
          break;
        } else if (i &lt; 1) {
          bar (0);
        } else
          return;
      default:
        ‚Ä¶
      }

    Since there are occasions where a switch case fall through is desirable, GCC provides
    an attribute, __attribute__ ((fallthrough)), that is to be used along with a null
    statement to suppress this warning that would normally occur:

    switch (cond)
      {
      case 1:
        bar (0);
        __attribute__ ((fallthrough));
      default:
        ‚Ä¶
      }

    C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the -Wimplicit-fallthrough warning using
    [[fallthrough]]; instead of the GNU attribute. In C++11 or C++14 users can use
    [[gnu::fallthrough]];, which is a GNU extension. Instead of these attributes, it is
    also possible to add a fallthrough comment to silence the warning. The whole body
    of the C or C++ style comment should match the given regular expressions listed below.
    The option argument n specifies what kind of comments are accepted:

    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=0 disables the warning altogether.
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=1 matches .* regular expression, any comment is used as fallthrough comment.
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=2 case insensitively matches .*falls?[ \t-]*thr(ough|u).* regular expression.
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 case sensitively matches one of the following regular expressions:
        -fallthrough
        @fallthrough@
        lint -fallthrough[ \t]*
        [ \t.!]*(ELSE,? |INTENTIONAL(LY)? )?
        FALL(S | |-)?THR(OUGH|U)[ \t.!]*(-[^\n\r]*)?
        [ \t.!]*(Else,? |Intentional(ly)? )?
        Fall((s | |-)[Tt]|t)hr(ough|u)[ \t.!]*(-[^\n\r]*)?
        [ \t.!]*([Ee]lse,? |[Ii]ntentional(ly)? )?
        fall(s | |-)?thr(ough|u)[ \t.!]*(-[^\n\r]*)?
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=4 case sensitively matches one of the following regular expressions:
        -fallthrough
        @fallthrough@
        lint -fallthrough[ \t]*
        [ \t]*FALLTHR(OUGH|U)[ \t]*
    -Wimplicit-fallthrough=5 doesn‚Äôt recognize any comments as fallthrough comments, only attributes disable the warning.

    The comment needs to be followed after optional whitespace and other comments by case
    or default keywords or by a user label that precedes some case or default label.

    switch (cond)
      {
      case 1:
        bar (0);
        /* FALLTHRU */
      default:
        ‚Ä¶
      }

    The -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 warning is enabled by -Wextra.

    The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not to inline a function. For
    example, the compiler takes into account the size of the function being inlined and the amount of
    inlining that has already been done in the current function. Therefore, seemingly insignificant
    changes in the source program can cause the warnings produced by -Winline to appear or disappear.

</pre>
    In this case, PRId64 is treated as a separate preprocessing token.

    Additionally, warn when a user-defined literal operator is declared with a

    <name>Warn when the indentation of the code does not reflect the block structure</name>
    <description>
    Warn when the indentation of the code does not reflect the block structure. Specifically,
    a warning is issued for if, else, while, and for clauses with a guarded statement that
    does not use braces, followed by an unguarded statement with the same indentation.

    In the following example, the call to ‚Äúbar‚Äù is misleadingly indented as if it were guarded
    by the ‚Äúif‚Äù conditional.

      if (some_condition ())
        foo ();
        bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the "if".  */

    In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the -ftabstop= option to determine
    if the statements line up (defaulting to 8).

    The warning is not issued for code involving multiline preprocessor logic such as the
    following example.

      if (flagA)
        foo (0);
    #if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD
      if (flagB)
    #endif
        foo (1);

    The warning is not issued after a #line directive, since this typically indicates
    autogenerated code, and no assumptions can be made about the layout of the file that the
    directive references.

    This warning is enabled by -Wall in C and C++.

    Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for "format" attributes. Note
    these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones. GCC will guess that function pointers with
    "format" attributes that are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return
    statements should have a corresponding "format" attribute in the resulting type. I.e. the left-hand
    side of the assignment or initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type
    of the containing function respectively should also have a "format" attribute to avoid the warning.

    GCC will also warn about function definitions that might be candidates for "format" attributes.
    Again, these are only possible candidates. GCC will guess that "format" attributes might be
    appropriate for any function that calls a function like "vprintf" or "vscanf", but this might not
    always be the case, and some functions for which "format" attributes are appropriate may not be
    detected.

    Disable warnings when non-templatized friend functions are declared within a template.
    Since the advent of explicit template specification support in G++, if the name of the friend is
    an unqualified-id (i.e., friend foo(int)), the C++ language specification demands that the friend
    declare or define an ordinary, nontemplate function. (Section 14.5.3). Before G++ implemented
    explicit specification, unqualified-ids could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a
    templatized function. Because this non-conforming behavior is no longer the default behavior for
    G++, -Wnon-template-friend allows the compiler to check existing code for potential trouble spots
    and is on by default. This new compiler behavior can be turned off with -Wno-non-template-friend,
    which keeps the conformant compiler code but disables the helpful warning.

    <description>
    In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are different sequences
    of characters. However, sometimes when characters outside the basic ASCII character set are used,
    you can have two different character sequences that look the same. To avoid confusion, the ISO
    10646 standard sets out some normalization rules which when applied ensure that two sequences that
    look the same are turned into the same sequence. GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers
    that have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.

    There are four levels of warning supported by GCC. The default is -Wnormalized=nfc, which warns
    about any identifier that is not in the ISO 10646 "C" normalized form, NFC. NFC is the recommended
    form for most uses.

    Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that, when
    turned into NFC, are not allowed in identifiers. That is, there's no way to use these symbols in
    portable ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC. -Wnormalized=id suppresses the warning
    for these characters. It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
    this, which is why this option is not the default.

    You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing -Wnormalized=none. You would only
    want to do this if you were using some other normalization scheme (like "D"), because otherwise
    you can easily create bugs that are literally impossible to see.

    Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical in some fonts or display
    methodologies, especially once formatting has been applied. For instance "\u207F", "SUPERSCRIPT
    LATIN SMALL LETTER N", will display just like a regular "n" that has been placed in a superscript.
    ISO 10646 defines the NFKC normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as well,
    and GCC will warn if your code is not in NFKC if you use -Wnormalized=nfkc. This warning is
    comparable to warning about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be confused
    with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be useful as a local coding convention if the
    programming environment is unable to be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

    <description>
    Warn about string constants that are longer than the "minimum maximum" length specified
    in the C standard. Modern compilers generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
    standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid using longer strings.

    The limit applies after string constant concatenation, and does not count the trailing NUL. In C90,
    the limit was 509 characters; in C99, it was raised to 4095. C++98 does not specify a normative
    minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.

    <description>
    Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such as when there is an
    assignment in a context where a truth value is expected, or when operators are nested whose
    precedence people often get confused about.

    Also warn if a comparison like x&lt;=y&lt;=z appears; this is equivalent to (x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z, which
    is a different interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.

    Also warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which "if" statement an "else"
    branch belongs. Here is an example of such a case:

            {
              if (a)
                if (b)
                  foo ();
              else
                bar ();
            }

    In C/C++, every "else" branch belongs to the innermost possible "if" statement, which in this
    example is "if (b)". This is often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
    example by indentation the programmer chose. When there is the potential for this confusion, GCC
    will issue a warning when this flag is specified. To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces
    around the innermost "if" statement so there is no way the "else" could belong to the enclosing
    "if". The resulting code would look like this:

            {
              if (a)
                {
                  if (b)
                    foo ();
                  else
                    bar ();
                }
            }

    Also warn for dangerous uses of the ?: with omitted middle operand GNU extension. When the condition
    in the ?: operator is a boolean expression the omitted value will be always 1. Often the user
    expects it to be a value computed inside the conditional expression instead.

    <name>Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior</name>
    <description>
    Warn about placement new expressions with undefined behavior, such as constructing an object in a
    buffer that is smaller than the type of the object. For example, the placement new expression below
    is diagnosed because it attempts to construct an array of 64 integers in a buffer only 64 bytes large.

    char buf [64];
    new (buf) int[64];

    This warning is enabled by default.

    -Wplacement-new=1

    This is the default warning level of -Wplacement-new. At this level the warning is not issued for
    some strictly undefined constructs that GCC allows as extensions for compatibility with legacy
    code. For example, the following new expression is not diagnosed at this level even though it has
    undefined behavior according to the C++ standard because it writes past the end of the one-element
    array.

    struct S { int n, a[1]; };
    S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 31 * sizeof s->a[0]);
    new (s->a)int [32]();

    -Wplacement-new=2

    At this level, in addition to diagnosing all the same constructs as at level 1, a diagnostic is
    also issued for placement new expressions that construct an object in the last member of structure
    whose type is an array of a single element and whose size is less than the size of the object being
    constructed. While the previous example would be diagnosed, the following construct makes use of the
    flexible member array extension to avoid the warning at level 2.

    struct S { int n, a[]; };
    S *s = (S *)malloc (sizeof *s + 32 * sizeof s->a[0]);
    new (s->a)int [32]();

    <name>Warn about possible violations of sequence point rules</name>
    <description>
    Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations of sequence
    point rules in the C and C++ standards.

    The C and C++ standards defines the order in which expressions in a C/C++ program are evaluated
    in terms of sequence points, which represent a partial ordering between the execution of parts of
    the program: those executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it. These occur
    after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part of a larger expression), after
    the evaluation of the first operand of a "&amp;&amp;", "||", "? :" or "," (comma) operator, before a
    function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the expression denoting the
    called function), and in certain other places. Other than as expressed by the sequence point
    rules, the order of evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified. All these
    rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order, since, for example, if two functions
    are called within one expression with no sequence point between them, the order in which the
    functions are called is not specified. However, the standards committee have ruled that function
    calls do not overlap.

    It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the values of objects take effect.
    Programs whose behavior depends on this have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify
    that "Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified
    at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only
    to determine the value to be stored.". If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
    particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.

    Examples of code with undefined behavior are "a = a++;", "a[n] = b[n++]" and "a[i++] = i;". Some
    more complicated cases are not diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false
    positive result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting this sort of
    problem in programs.

    The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate over the precise meaning of the
    sequence point rules in subtle cases. Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed
    formal definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at http://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html.

    type, or class member (in C++), or whenever a built-in function is shadowed. Note that in C++,
    the compiler will not warn if a local variable shadows a struct/class/enum, but will warn if it
    shadows an explicit typedef.

    This is the warning level of -Wshift-overflow and is enabled by default in C99 and C++11
    modes (and newer). This warning level does not warn about left-shifting 1 into the sign bit.
    (However, in C, such an overflow is still rejected in contexts where an integer constant
    expression is required.)

    -Wshift-overflow=2

    This warning level also warns about left-shifting 1 into the sign bit, unless C++14 mode is

    <description><![CDATA[<p>
    Warn about code which might break the strict aliasing rules that the compiler is using
    for optimization. The warning does not catch all cases, but does attempt to catch the more common
    pitfalls. Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives). Higher levels also
    correspond to more effort, similar to the way -O works. -Wstrict-aliasing is equivalent to

    -fstrict-aliasing still breaks the code, as it has very few false negatives.  However, it has many
    false positives.  Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types, even if
    never dereferenced.  Runs in the frontend only.</p>

    <p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.  May still have many false positives (not as many as
    level 1 though), and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).  Unlike level 1, it
    only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about incomplete types.  Runs in the frontend only.</p>

    <p>Level 3 (default for -Wstrict-aliasing): Should have very few false positives and few false negatives.
    Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled. Takes care of the common pun+dereference
    pattern in the frontend: "*(int*)&amp;some_float". If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the
    backend, where it deals with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
    Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced. Does not warn about incomplete types.</p>

    <name>Warn about optimizations that assume that signed overflow is undefined</name>
    <description>
    Warn about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the assumption that signed
    overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not warn about all cases where the code might overflow:
    it only warns about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus this warning
    depends  on the optimization level.

    An optimization which assumes that signed overflow does not occur is perfectly safe if the values
    of the variables involved are such that overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning
    can easily give a false positive: a warning about code which is not actually a problem. To help
    focus on important issues, several warning levels are defined. No warnings are issued for the use
    of undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop will require, in particular
    when determining whether a loop will be executed at all.

    -Wstrict-overflow=1
        Warn about cases which are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For example: "x + 1 &gt; x"; with
        -fstrict-overflow, the compiler will simplify this to 1.  This level of -Wstrict-overflow is
        enabled by -Wall; higher levels are not, and must be explicitly requested.

    -Wstrict-overflow=2
        Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a constant.  For example:
        "abs (x) &gt;= 0".  This can only be simplified when -fstrict-overflow is in effect, because
        "abs (INT_MIN)" overflows to "INT_MIN", which is less than zero. -Wstrict-overflow (with no
        level) is the same as -Wstrict-overflow=2.

    -Wstrict-overflow=3
        Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For example: "x + 1 &gt; 1" will
        be simplified to "x &gt; 0".

    -Wstrict-overflow=4
        Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.  For example: "(x * 10) / 5"
        will be simplified to "x * 2".

    -Wstrict-overflow=5
        Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a constant involved in a
        comparison.  For example: "x + 2 &gt; y" will be simplified to "x + 1 &gt;= y". This is reported
        only at the highest warning level because this simplification applies to many comparisons,
        so this warning level will give a very large number of false positives.

    <description>
    Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as memcpy and strcpy that are determined
    to overflow the destination buffer. The optional argument is one greater than the type of
    Object Size Checking to perform to determine the size of the destination. See Object Size
    Checking. The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays but
    not for raw memory functions like memcpy which always make use of Object Size type-0. The
    option also warns for calls that specify a size in excess of the largest possible object or
    at most SIZE_MAX / 2 bytes. The option produces the best results with optimization enabled
    but can detect a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in calls
    to the GCC built-in functions like __builtin_memcpy that correspond to the standard functions.
    In any case, the option warns about just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the
    corresponding overflow checking built-ins. For example, the option will issue a warning for
    the strcpy call below because it copies at least 5 characters (the string "blue" including
    the terminating NUL) into the buffer of size 4.

    enum Color { blue, purple, yellow };
    const char* f (enum Color clr)
    {
      static char buf [4];
      const char *str;
      switch (clr)
        {
          case blue: str = "blue"; break;
          case purple: str = "purple"; break;
          case yellow: str = "yellow"; break;
        }

      return strcpy (buf, str);   // warning here
    }

    Option -Wstringop-overflow=2 is enabled by default.

    -Wstringop-overflow
    -Wstringop-overflow=1

    The -Wstringop-overflow=1 option uses type-zero Object Size Checking to determine the sizes
    of destination objects. This is the default setting of the option. At this setting the option
    will not warn for writes past the end of subobjects of larger objects accessed by pointers
    unless the size of the largest surrounding object is known. When the destination may be one of
    several objects it is assumed to be the largest one of them. On Linux systems, when
    optimization is enabled at this setting the option warns for the same code as when the
    _FORTIFY_SOURCE macro is defined to a non-zero value.

    -Wstringop-overflow=2

    The -Wstringop-overflow=2 option uses type-one Object Size Checking to determine the sizes of
    destination objects. At this setting the option will warn about overflows when writing to
    members of the largest complete objects whose exact size is known. It will, however, not warn
    for excessive writes to the same members of unknown objects referenced by pointers since they
    may point to arrays containing unknown numbers of elements.

    -Wstringop-overflow=3

    The -Wstringop-overflow=3 option uses type-two Object Size Checking to determine the sizes of
    destination objects. At this setting the option warns about overflowing the smallest object or
    data member. This is the most restrictive setting of the option that may result in warnings
    for safe code.

    -Wstringop-overflow=4

    The -Wstringop-overflow=4 option uses type-three Object Size Checking to determine the sizes
    of destination objects. At this setting the option will warn about overflowing any data
    members, and when the destination is one of several objects it uses the size of the largest of
    them to decide whether to issue a warning. Similarly to -Wstringop-overflow=3 this setting of
    the option may result in warnings for benign code.

    -Wsuggest-attribute=pure
    -Wsuggest-attribute=const
    -Wsuggest-attribute=noreturn

    Warn about functions that might be candidates for attributes pure, const or noreturn. The compiler
    only warns for functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of pure and const) if
    it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function returns normally if it doesn‚Äôt
    contain an infinite loop or return abnormally by throwing, calling abort or trapping. This analysis
    requires option -fipa-pure-const, which is enabled by default at -O and higher. Higher optimization
    levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.

    -Wsuggest-attribute=format
    -Wmissing-format-attribute

    Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for format attributes. Note these are only
    possible candidates, not absolute ones. GCC guesses that function pointers with format attributes
    that are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return statements should have a
    corresponding format attribute in the resulting type. I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
    initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type of the containing function
    respectively should also have a format attribute to avoid the warning.

    GCC also warns about function definitions that might be candidates for format attributes. Again,
    these are only possible candidates. GCC guesses that format attributes might be appropriate for any
    function that calls a function like vprintf or vscanf, but this might not always be the case, and
    some functions for which format attributes are appropriate may not be detected.

    <description>
    Warn about functions which might be candidates for attribute "pure". The compiler
    only warns for functions visible in other compilation units or (in the case of "pure" and "const")
    if it cannot prove that the function returns normally. A function returns normally if it doesn't
    contain an infinite loop nor returns abnormally by throwing, calling "abort()" or trapping. This
    analysis requires option -fipa-pure-const, which is enabled by default at -O and higher. Higher
    optimization levels improve the accuracy of the analysis.

    Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and ISO C. Also
    warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C equivalent, and/or problematic constructs
    which should be avoided.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.  In traditional C macro
        replacement takes place within string literals, but does not in ISO C.</li>
    <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.  Traditional preprocessors would
        only consider a line to be a directive if the # appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
        -Wtraditional warns about directives that traditional C understands but would ignore because the #
        does not appear as the first character on the line. It also suggests you hide directives like #pragma
        not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some traditional implementations would not
        recognize #elif, so it suggests avoiding it altogether.</li>
    <li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.</li>
    <li>The unary plus operator.</li>
    <li>The U integer constant suffix, or the F or L floating point constant suffixes.  (Traditional C
        does support the L suffix on integer constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined
        in the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the _MIN/_MAX macros in "&lt;limits.h&gt;".
        Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCC's integrated
        preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these cases.</li>
    <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of the block.</li>
    <li>A "switch" statement has an operand of type "long".</li>
    <li>A non-"static" function declaration follows a "static" one.  This construct is not accepted by
        some traditional C compilers.</li>
    <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or signedness from its traditional type.
        This warning is only issued if the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values,
        which typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.</li>
    <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.</li>
    <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.</li>
    <li>Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate namespace for labels.</li>
    <li>Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is omitted.  This is done under
        the assumption that the zero initializer in user code appears conditioned on e.g. "__STDC__" to
        avoid missing initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the traditional
        C case.</li>
    <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating point values and vice versa.  The absence of
        these prototypes when compiling with traditional C would cause serious problems.  This is a subset
        of the possible conversion warnings, for the full set use -Wtraditional-conversion.</li>
    <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is not issued for prototype
        declarations or variadic functions because these ISO C features will appear in your code when
        using libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, "PARAMS" and "VPARAMS".  This warning is
        also bypassed for nested functions because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not
        relevant to traditional C compatibility.</li>

    some targets, it is made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment. But, for most
    targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack to be made executable in order for
    the program to work properly.

    <name>Warn about uninitialized automatic variables</name>
    <description>
    Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized or if a variable
    may be clobbered by a "setjmp" call. In C++, warn if a non-static reference or non-static const
    member appears in a class without constructors.

    If you want to warn about code which uses the uninitialized value of the variable in its own
    initializer, use the -Winit-self option.

    These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered elements of structure, union or
    array variables as well as for variables which are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They
    do not occur for variables or elements declared "volatile".  Because these warnings depend on
    optimization, the exact variables or elements for which there are warnings will depend on the
    precise optimization options and version of GCC used.

    Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only to compute a value that itself
    is never used, because such computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
    are printed.

    These warnings are made optional because GCC is not smart enough to see all the reasons why the
    code might be correct despite appearing to have an error.  Here is one example of how this can
    happen:

            {
              int x;
              switch (y)
                {
                case 1: x = 1;
                  break;
                case 2: x = 4;
                  break;
                case 3: x = 5;
                }
              foo (x);
            }

    If the value of "y" is always 1, 2 or 3, then "x" is always initialized, but GCC doesn't know this.
    Here is another common case:

            {
              int save_y;
              if (change_y) save_y = y, y = new_y;
              ...
              if (change_y) y = save_y;
            }

    This has no bug because "save_y" is used only if it is set.

    This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be changed by a call to "longjmp".
    These warnings as well are possible only in optimizing compilation.

    The compiler sees only the calls to "setjmp".  It cannot know where "longjmp" will be called; in
    fact, a signal handler could call it at any point in the code. As a result, you may get a warning
    even when there is in fact no problem because "longjmp" cannot in fact be called at the place which
    would cause a problem.

    Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions you use that never return as
    "noreturn".

    <description>
    Warn whenever a constant static variable is unused aside from its declaration.
    -Wunused-const-variable=1 is enabled by -Wunused-variable for C, but not for C++.
    In C this declares variable storage, but in C++ this is not an error since const
    variables take the place of #defines.

    To suppress this warning use the unused attribute (see Variable Attributes).

    -Wunused-const-variable=1

    This is the warning level that is enabled by -Wunused-variable for C. It warns only
    about unused static const variables defined in the main compilation unit, but not
    about static const variables declared in any header included.

    -Wunused-const-variable=2

    This warning level also warns for unused constant static variables in headers
    (excluding system headers). This is the warning level of -Wunused-const-variable and
    must be explicitly requested since in C++ this isn‚Äôt an error and in C it might be
    harder to clean up all headers included.

    <name>Warn about macros defined in the main file that are not used</name>
    <description>
    Warn about macros defined in the main file that are unused.  A macro is used if it
    is expanded or tested for existence at least once.  The preprocessor will also warn if the macro
    has not been used at the time it is redefined or undefined.

    Built-in macros, macros defined on the command line, and macros defined in include files are not
    warned about.

    Note: If a macro is actually used, but only used in skipped conditional blocks, then CPP will
    report it as unused. To avoid the warning in such a case, you might improve the scope of the
    macro's definition by, for example, moving it into the first skipped block.  Alternatively, you
    could provide a dummy use with something like:

            #if defined the_macro_causing_the_warning
            #endif

    Warn if vector operation is not implemented via SIMD capabilities of the architecture.
    Mainly useful for the performance tuning. Vector operation can be implemented "piecewise", which
    means that the scalar operation is performed on every vector element; "in parallel", which means
    that the vector operation is implemented using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance
    efficient; and "as a single scalar", which means that vector fits into a scalar type.

    <description>
    If this option is used, the compiler will warn on uses of variable-length arrays
    where the size is either unbounded, or bounded by an argument that can be larger
    than n bytes. This is similar to how -Walloca-larger-than=n works, but with
    variable-length arrays.

    Note that GCC may optimize small variable-length arrays of a known value into
    plain arrays, so this warning may not get triggered for such arrays.

    This warning is not enabled by -Wall, and is only active when -ftree-vrp is active
    (default for -O2 and above).

    See also -Walloca-larger-than=n.

    <description>
    When compiling C, give string constants the type "const char[length]" so that copying
    the address of one into a non-"const" "char *" pointer will get a warning.  These warnings will
    help you find at compile time code that can try to write into a string constant, but only if you
    have been very careful about using "const" in declarations and prototypes.  Otherwise, it will
    just be a nuisance. This is why we did not make -Wall request these warnings.

    When compiling C++, warn about the deprecated conversion from string literals to "char *".  This
    warning is enabled by default for C++ programs.
