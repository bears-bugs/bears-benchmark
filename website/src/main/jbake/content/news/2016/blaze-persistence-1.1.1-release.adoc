This release includes some bugfixes for the core module

* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/215[*#215*, window="_blank"] PaginatedCriteriaBuilder workaround for composite id entities
* https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/197[*#197*, window="_blank"] Hibernate integration issue

This will probably be the last release for the 1.1 branch as 1.2 is approaching the first Alpha release which is quite stable from a user perspective. We recommend updating to 1.2.0-Alpha1 directly.
