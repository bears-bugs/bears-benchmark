# feign-mock

An easy way to test https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign. Since feign stores most of the logic in annotations, this helps to check if the annotations are correct.

The original article is available https://velo.github.io/2016/06/05/Testing-feign-clients.html[here]

If mocking feign clients is easy, testing the logic written in annotations is not!

To check if you are parsing the request/response properly, the only way is firing a real request. Well, that doesn't seem to be a good path to unit (or even integration) test remote services. Any IO change will affect test stability.

With feign-mock you can use pre-loaded JSON strings or streams as content for your responses. It also allows you to verify mocked invocations and feign-mock will hit your annotations to make sure everything works.

##### Example

```
  private GitHub github;
  private MockClient mockClient;

  @Before
  public void setup() throws IOException {
    mockClient = new MockClient()
        .noContent(HttpMethod.PATCH, "/repos/velo/feign-mock/contributors");

    github = Feign.builder()
        .decoder(new GsonDecoder())
        .client(mockClient)
        .target(new MockTarget<>(GitHub.class));
  }

  @After
  public void tearDown() {
    mockClient.verifyStatus();
  }

  @Test
  public void missHttpMethod() {
    List<Contributor> result = github.patchContributors("velo", "feign-mock");
    assertThat(result, nullValue());
    mockClient.verifyOne(HttpMethod.PATCH, "/repos/velo/feign-mock/contributors");
  }
```

This simple test returns no content and verifies that the URL was truly invoked.

On the mocked client, you can include all URLs and methods you want to mock.
