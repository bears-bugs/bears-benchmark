This is a simple tutorial on compiling libActiveMQLibAIO.so

DEPENDENCIES

Make sure you install these packages:

- G++ (yum install gcc-c++ or aptitude install g++)
- Gcc (yum insall gcc or aptitude install gcc)
- JDK (full JDK)


LIBAIO INFORMATION

libaio is part of the kernel project. The library makes system calls on the kernel layer.

This is the project information:

Git Repository:  git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libaio/libaio.git
Mailing List:    linux-aio@kvack.org


STEPS TO BUILD

1. Make sure you have JAVA_HOME defined, and pointing to the root of your JDK:

Example:

 $> export JAVA_HOME=/usr/share/jdk1.7


2. Call compile-native.sh. Bootstrap will call all the initial scripts you need
 $>  ./compile-native.sh

if you are missing any dependencies, autoconf would tell you what you're missing.


COMPILED FILE

The produced file will be under the ./target/nar (example: ./target/nar/artemis-native-1.0.0-amd64-Linux-gpp-jni/lib/amd64-Linux-gpp/jni/libartemis-native-1.0.0.so)
and you will have to rename it manually under ./bin following the appropriate pattern.


DOCUMENTATION

The User Manual, chapter 38 (Libaio Native Libraries) will provide more details about our native libraries on libaio.
