	<type type="boolean">
		<description>
			* `true` - Reorder columns during the drag operation initiated by the end user
			* `false` - Only reorder columns when the dragged element has been dropped.
		</description>
	</type>

	<default value="true">
		Columns will be reordered during a drag operation
	</default>

	<description>
		ColReorder will visually give the end user feedback about the reordering operation by showing an insert marker and also reordering the columns during the drag operation (by default). This option provides the option to turn the latter feedback mechanism off. You may wish to do this if you are targeting older browsers or older computers with complex tables as it can impact performance.
