### Characteristics of the Default Implementation

#### Changes wrt Jackrabbit 2.x

The user query is expected to work as in Jackrabbit 2.x with the following notable
bug fixes:

* `QueryBuilder#setScope(String groupID, boolean declaredOnly)` now also works properly
  for the everyone group (see [OAK-949])
* `QueryBuilder#impersonates(String principalName)` works properly for the admin
  principal which are specially treated in the implementation of the `Impersonation`
  interface (see [OAK-1183]).
