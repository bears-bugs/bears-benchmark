/**
 * A simple class which computes a random, maximum cardinality matching. The algorithm can run in
 * two modes: sorted or unsorted. When unsorted, the matching is obtained by iterating through the
 * edges and adding an edge if it doesn't conflict with the edges already in the matching. When
 * sorted, the edges are first sorted by the sum of degrees of their endpoints. After that, the
 * algorithm proceeds in the same manner. Running this algorithm in sorted mode can sometimes
 * produce better results, albeit at the cost of some additional computational overhead.
 * <p>
 * Independent of the mode, the resulting matching is maximal, and is therefore guaranteed to
 * contain at least half of the edges that a maximum matching has ($\frac{1}{2}$ approximation).
 * Runtime complexity: $O(m)$ when the edges are not sorted, $O(m+ m \log n)$ otherwise, where $n$
 * is the number of vertices, and m the number of edges.
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
