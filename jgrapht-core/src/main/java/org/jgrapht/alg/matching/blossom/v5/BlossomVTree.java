/**
 * This class is a data structure for Kolmogorov's Blossom V algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Represents an alternating tree of <em>tight</em> edges which is used to find an augmenting path of tight edges
 * in order to perform an augmentation and increase the cardinality of the matching. The nodes on odd layers
 * are necessarily connected to their children via matched edges. Thus, these nodes have always exactly one child.
 * The nodes on even layers can have arbitrarily many children.
 * <p>
 * The tree structure information is contained in {@link BlossomVNode}, this class only contains the reference
 * to the root of the tree. It also contains three heaps:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A heap of (+, inf) edges. These edges are also called infinity edges. If there exists a tight
 * infinity edge, then it can be grown. Thus, this heap is used to determine an infinity edge of
 * minimum slack.</li>
 * <li>A heap of (+, +) in-tree edges. These are edges between "+" nodes from the same tree. If a (+, +)
 * in-tree edges is tight, it can be used to perform the shrink operation and introduce a new blossom. Thus,
 * this heap is used to determine a (+, +) in-tree edge of minimum slack in a given tree.</li>
 * <li>A heap of "-" blossoms. If there exists a blossom with zero actual dual variable, it can be expanded.
 * Thus, this heap is used to determine a "-" blossom with minimum dual variable</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each tree contains a variable which accumulates dual changes applied to it. The dual changes aren't spread until
 * a tree is destroyed by an augmentation. For every node in the tree its true dual variable is equal to
 * {@code node.dual + node.tree.eps} if it is a "+" node; otherwise it equals {@code node.dual - node.tree.eps}. This applies
 * only to the surface nodes that belong to some tree.
 * <p>
 * This class also contains implementations of two iterators: {@link TreeEdgeIterator} and {@link TreeNodeIterator}.
 * They are used to conveniently traverse the tree edges incident to a particular tree, and to traverse the nodes
 * of a tree in a depth-first order.
