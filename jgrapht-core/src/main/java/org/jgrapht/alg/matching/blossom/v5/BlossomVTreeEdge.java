/**
 * This class is a data structure for Kolmogorov's Blossom V algorithm.
 * <p>
 * Is used to maintain an auxiliary graph whose nodes correspond to alternating trees in the Blossom V algorithm.
 * Let's denote the current tree $T$ and some other tree $T'$. Every tree edge contains three heaps:<br>
 * <ol>
 * <li>a heap of (+, +) cross-tree edges. This heap contains all edges between two "+" nodes where one node
 * belongs to tree $T$ and another to $T'$. The (+, +) cross-tree edges are used to augment the matching.</li>
 * <li>a heap of (+, -) cross-tree edges</li>
 * <li>a heap of (-, +) cross-tree edges</li>
 * </ol>
 * <b>Note:</b> from the tree edge perspective there is no difference between a heap of (+, -) and (-, +)
 * cross-tree edges. That's why we distinguish these heaps by the direction of the edge. Here the direction is considered
 * with respect to the trees $T$ and $T'$ based upon the notation introduced above.
 * <p>
 * Every tree edge is directed from one tree to another and every tree edge belongs to the two doubly
 * linked lists of tree edges. The presence of a tree edge in these lists in maintained by the two-element
 * arrays {@link BlossomVTreeEdge#prev} and {@link BlossomVTreeEdge#next}. For one tree the edge is an outgoing tree edge; for the other,
 * an incoming. In the first case it belongs to the {@code tree.first[0]} linked list; in the second, to the
 * {@code tree.first[1]} linked list.
 * <p>
 * Let {@code tree} be a tail of the edge, and {@code oppositeTree} a head of the edge. Then
 * {@code edge.head[0] == oppositeTree} and {@code edge.head[1] == tree}.
