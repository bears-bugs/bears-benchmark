/**
 * This implementation of Edmonds' blossom algorithm computes maximum cardinality matchings in
 * undirected graphs. A matching in a graph $G(V,E)$ is a subset of edges $M$ such that no two edges
 * in $M$ have a vertex in common. A matching has at most $\frac{1}{2|V|}$ edges. A node $v$ in $G$
 * is matched by matching $M$ if $M$ contains an edge incident to $v$. A matching is perfect if all
 * nodes are matched. By definition, a perfect matching consists of exactly $\frac{1}{2|V|}$ edges.
 * This algorithm will return a perfect matching if one exists. If no perfect matching exists, then
 * the largest (non-perfect) matching is returned instead. This algorithm does NOT compute a maximum
 * weight matching. In the special case that the input graph is bipartite, consider using
 * {@link HopcroftKarpMaximumCardinalityBipartiteMatching} instead.
 * <p>
 * To compute a maximum cardinality matching, at most $n$ augmenting path computations are
 * performed. Each augmenting path computation takes $O(m \alpha(m,n))$ time, where $\alpha(m,n)$ is
 * an inverse of the Ackerman function, $n$ is the number of vertices, and $m$ the number of edges.
 * This results in a total runtime complexity of O(nm alpha(m,n)). In practise, the number of
 * augmenting path computations performed is far smaller than $n$, since an efficient heuristic is
 * used to compute a near-optimal initial solution. This implementation is highly efficient: a
 * maximum matching in a graph of 2000 vertices and 1.5 million edges is calculated in a few
 * milliseconds on a desktop computer.<br>
 * The runtime complexity of this implementation could be improved to $O(nm)$ when the UnionFind
 * data structure used in this implementation is replaced by the linear-time set union data
 * structure proposed in: Gabow, H.N., Tarjan, R.E. A linear-time algorithm for a special case of
 * disjoint set union. Proc. Fifteenth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 1982, pp.
 * 246-251.
 * <p>
 * Edmonds' original algorithm first appeared in Edmonds, J. Paths, trees, and flowers. Canadian
 * Journal of Mathematics 17, 1965, pp. 449-467, and had a runtime complexity of $O(n^4)$. This
 * implementation however follows more closely the description provided in Tarjan, R.E. Data
 * Structures and Network Algorithms. Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 1983, chapter
 * 9. In addition, the following sources were used for the implementation:
