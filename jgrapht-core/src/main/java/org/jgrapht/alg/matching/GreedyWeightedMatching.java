/**
 * The greedy algorithm for computing a maximum weight matching in an arbitrary graph. The algorithm
 * runs in $O(m + m \log n)$ where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$ is the number of edges of
 * the graph. This implementation accepts directed and undirected graphs which may contain
 * self-loops and multiple (parallel) edges. There is no assumption on the edge weights, i.e. they
 * can also be negative or zero.
 * 
 * <p>
 * This algorithm can be run in two modes: with and without edge cost normalization. Without
 * normalization, the algorithm first orders the edge set in non-increasing order of weights and
 * then greedily constructs a maximal cardinality matching out of the edges with positive weight. A
 * maximal cardinality matching (not to be confused with maximum cardinality) is a matching that
 * cannot be increased in cardinality without removing an edge first. The resulting matching is
 * guaranteed to be a $\frac{1}{2}$-Approximation. <br>
 * With normalization, the edges are sorted in non-increasing order of their normalized costs
 * $\frac{c(u,v)}{d(u)+d(v)}$ instead, after which the algorithm proceeds in the same manner. Here,
 * $c(u,v)$ is the cost of edge $(u,v)$, and $d(u)$ resp $d(v)$ are the degrees of vertices $u$ resp
 * $v$. Running this algorithm in normalized mode often (but not always!) produces a better result
 * than running the algorithm without normalization. <i>Note however that the normalized version
 * does NOT produce a $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation</i>. See <a href=
 * "https://mathoverflow.net/questions/269526/is-greedy-matching-algorithm-with-normalized-edge-weights-a-2-approximation/269760#269760">this
 * proof for details.</a> The runtime complexity remains the same, independent of whether
 * normalization is used.
