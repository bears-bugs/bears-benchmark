/**
 * This class computes a maximum flow in a
 * <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_network">flow network</a> using
 * <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds-Karp_algorithm">Edmonds-Karp algorithm</a>. Given
 * is a weighted directed or undirected graph $G(V,E)$ with vertex set $V$ and edge set $E$. Each
 * edge $e\in E$ has an associated non-negative capacity $u_e$. The maximum flow problem involves
 * finding a feasible flow from a source vertex $s$ to a sink vertex $t$ which is maximum. The
 * amount of flow $f_e$ through any edge $e$ cannot exceed capacity $u_e$. Moreover, flow
 * conservation must hold: the sum of flows entering a node must equal the sum of flows exiting that
 * node, except for the source and the sink nodes.
 * <p>
 * Mathematically, the maximum flow problem is stated as follows: \[ \begin{align} \max~&amp;
 * \sum_{e\in \delta^+(s)}f_e &amp;\\ \mbox{s.t. }&amp;\sum_{e\in \delta^-(i)} f_e=\sum_{e\in
 * \delta^+(i)} f_e &amp; \forall i\in V\setminus\{s,t\}\\ &amp;0\leq f_e \leq u_e &amp; \forall
 * e\in E \end{align} \] Here $\delta^+(i)$ resp $\delta^-(i)$ denote resp the outgoing and incoming
 * edges of vertex $i$.
 * <p>
 * When the input graph is undirected, an edge $(i,j)$ is treated as two directed arcs: $(i,j)$ and
 * $(j,i)$. In such a case, there is the additional restriction that the flow can only go in one
 * direction: the flow either goes form $i$ to $j$, or from $j$ to $i$, but there cannot be a
 * positive flow on $(i,j)$ and $(j,i)$ simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * The runtime complexity of this class is $O(nm^2)$, where $n$ is the number of vertices and $m$
 * the number of edges in the graph. For a more efficient algorithm, consider using
 * {@link PushRelabelMFImpl} instead.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can also compute minimum s-t cuts. Effectively, to compute a minimum s-t cut, the
 * implementation first computes a minimum s-t flow, after which a BFS is run on the residual graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * For more details see Andrew V. Goldberg's <i>Combinatorial Optimization (Lecture Notes)</i>.
 *
 * Note: even though the algorithm accepts any kind of graph, currently only Simple directed and
 * undirected graphs are supported (and tested!).
