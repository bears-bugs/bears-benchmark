/**
 * An implementation of Suurballe algorithm for finding K edge-<em>disjoint</em> shortest paths.
 * The algorithm determines the k disjoint shortest simple paths in increasing order of
 * weight. Only directed simple graphs are allowed.
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm is running k sequential Dijkstra iterations to find the shortest path at each step.
 * Hence, yielding a complexity of k*O(Dijkstra).
