/**
 * A base implementation of a $k$ disjoint shortest paths algorithm based on the strategy used in 
 * Suurballe and Bhandari algorithms.
 * The algorithm procedure goes as follow:
 * <ol>
 * <li> Using some known shortest path algorithm (e.g. Dijkstra) to find the shortest
 * path $P_1$ from source to target.
 * <li> For i = 2,...,$k$
 * <li> &emsp;Perform some graph transformations based on the previously found path
 * <li> &emsp;Find the shortest path $P_i$ from source to target
 * <li> Remove all overlapping edges to get $k$ disjoint paths.
 * </ol> 
 * The class implements the above procedure and resolves final paths (step 5) from the
 * intermediate path results found in step 4.
 * An extending class has to implement two methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #transformGraph} - to be used in step 3.
 * <li> {@link #calculateShortestPath} - to be used in step 4.
 * </ul>
 * Currently known extensions are {@link SuurballeKDisjointShortestPaths} and 
 * {@link BhandariKDisjointShortestPaths}.
 * 
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
