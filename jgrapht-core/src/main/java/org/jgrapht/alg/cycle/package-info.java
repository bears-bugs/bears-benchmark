 * <h3>Algorithms for enumeration of simple cycles in graphs</h3>
 * 
 * Contains four different algorithms for the enumeration of simple cycles in directed graphs. The
 * worst case time complexity of the algorithms is:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Szwarcfiter and Lauer - $O(V + EC)$</li>
 * <li>Tarjan - $O(VEC)$</li>
 * <li>Johnson - $O(((V+E)C)$</li>
 * <li>Tiernan - $O(V.const^V)$</li>
 * </ol>
 * where $V$ is the number of vertices, $E$ is the number of edges and $C$ is the number of the
 * simple cycles in the graph. All the above implementations work correctly with loops but not with
 * multiple edges. Space complexity for all cases is $O(V+E)$.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The worst case performance is achieved for graphs with special structure, so on practical
 * workloads an algorithm with higher worst case complexity may outperform an algorithm with lower
 * worst case complexity. Note also that "administrative costs" of algorithms with better worst case
 * performance are higher. Also higher is their memory cost.

 * <h3>Algorithms for the computation of undirected cycle basis</h3>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>A variant of Paton's algorithm {@link org.jgrapht.alg.cycle.PatonCycleBase}, performing a BFS
 * using a stack which returns a weakly fundamental cycle basis. Supports graphs with self-loops but
 * not multiple (parallel) edges.</li>
 * <li>A variant of Paton's algorithm {@link org.jgrapht.alg.cycle.StackBFSFundamentalCycleBasis},
 * which returns a fundamental cycle basis. This is a more generic implementation which supports
 * self-loops and multiple (parallel) edges.</li>
 * <li>An algorithm {@link org.jgrapht.alg.cycle.QueueBFSFundamentalCycleBasis} which constructs a
 * fundamental cycle basis using a straightforward implementation of BFS using a queue. The
 * implementation supports graphs with self-loops and multiple (parallel) edges.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The worst case time complexity of all above algorithms is $O(|V|^3)$ since the length of the
 * cycle basis can be that large.
