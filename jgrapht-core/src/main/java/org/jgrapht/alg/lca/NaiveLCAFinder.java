/**
 * Find the Lowest Common Ancestor of a directed graph.
 *
 * <p>
 * Find the LCA, defined as <i>Let $G = (V, E)$ be a DAG, and let $x, y \in V$ . Let $G x,y$ be the
 * subgraph of $G$ induced by the set of all common ancestors of $x$ and $y$. Define SLCA (x, y) to
 * be the set of out-degree 0 nodes (leafs) in $G x,y$. The lowest common ancestors of $x$ and $y$
 * are the elements of SLCA (x, y). This naive algorithm simply starts at $a$ and $b$, recursing
 * upwards to the root(s) of the DAG. Wherever the recursion paths cross we have found our LCA.</i>
 * from <i> Michael A. Bender, Mart√≠n Farach-Colton, Giridhar Pemmasani, Steven Skiena, Pavel Sumazin,
 * Lowest common ancestors in trees and directed acyclic graphs,
 * Journal of Algorithms, Volume 57, Issue 2, 2005, Pages 75-94, ISSN 0196-6774,
 * https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jalgor.2005.08.001. </i>
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm:
 *
 * <pre>
 * 1. Start at each of nodes you wish to find the lca for (a and b)
 * 2. Create sets aSet containing a, and bSet containing b
 * 3. If either set intersects with the union of the other sets previous values (i.e. the set of notes visited) then
 *    that intersection is LCA. if there are multiple intersections then the earliest one added is the LCA.
 * 4. Repeat from step 3, with aSet now the parents of everything in aSet, and bSet the parents of everything in bSet
 * 5. If there are no more parents to descend to then there is no LCA
 * </pre>
 *
 * The rationale for this working is that in each iteration of the loop we are considering all the
 * ancestors of a that have a path of length n back to a, where n is the depth of the recursion. The
 * same is true of b.
 *
 * <p>
 * We start by checking if a == b.<br>
 * if not we look to see if there is any intersection between parents(a) and (parents(b) union b)
 * (and the same with a and b swapped)<br>
 * if not we look to see if there is any intersection between parents(parents(a)) and
 * (parents(parents(b)) union parents(b) union b) (and the same with a and b swapped)<br>
 * continues
 *
 * <p>
 * This means at the end of recursion n, we know if there is an LCA that has a path of &lt;=n to a
 * and b. Of course we may have to wait longer if the path to a is of length n, but the path to
 * b&gt;n. at the first loop we have a path of 0 length from the nodes we are considering as LCA to
 * their respective children which we wish to find the LCA for.
