/**
 * This is an implementation of the VF2 algorithm using its feature of detecting subgraph
 * isomorphism between two graphs as described in Cordella et al. A (sub)graph isomorphism algorithm
 * for matching large graphs (2004), DOI:10.1109/TPAMI.2004.75,
 * <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1323804">
 * http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=1323804</a>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that this inspector only finds isomorphisms between a smaller graph and all
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Vertex-InducedSubgraph.html">induced subgraphs</a> of a
 * larger graph. It does not find isomorphisms between the smaller graph and arbitrary subgraphs of
 * the larger graph. For example, given as input the
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CubicalGraph.html">cubical graph</a> $Q_{3}$ and the
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SquareGraph.html">square graph</a>, isomorphic mappings
 * will be found between the square and the faces of the cube. However, given the
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CompleteGraph.html">complete graph</a> $K_{5}$ and the
 * square graph as input, no isomorphisms will be found since all induced subgraphs of a complete
 * graph are themselves complete graphs.
 *
 * <p>
 * Consequently, in the case where both input graphs have the same number of vertices, this
 * algorithm is equivalent to running {@link VF2GraphIsomorphismInspector}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This implementation of the VF2 algorithm does not support graphs with multiple (parallel) edges.
 *
 * @param <V> the type of the vertices
 * @param <E> the type of the edges
