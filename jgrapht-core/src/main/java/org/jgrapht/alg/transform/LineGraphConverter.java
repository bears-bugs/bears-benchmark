/**
 * Converter which produces the
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LineGraph.html">line graph</a> of a given input
 * graph.
 * The line graph of an undirected graph $G$ is another graph $L(G)$ that represents the
 * adjacencies between edges of $G$. The line graph of a directed graph $G$ is the directed graph $L(G)$ whose vertex set
 * corresponds to the arc set of $G$ and having an arc directed from an edge $e_1$ to an
 * edge $e_2$ if in $G$, the head of $e_1$ meets the tail of $e_2$
 *
 * <p>
 * More formally, let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph then its line graph $L(G)$ is such that
 * <ul>
 * <li>Each vertex of $L(G)$ represents an edge of $G$</li>
 * <li>If $G$ is undirected: two vertices of $L(G)$ are adjacent if and only if their corresponding edges share
 * a common endpoint ("are incident") in $G$ </li>
 * <li>If $G$ is directed: two vertices of $L(G)$ corresponding to respectively arcs $(u,v)$ and $(r,s)$ in $G$ are adjacent
 * if and only if $v=r$.</li>
 * </ul>

     * The result is stored in the target graph. A weight function is provided to set edge weights of the line graph
     * edges. Notice that the target graph must be a weighted graph for this to work. Recall that in a line graph
     * $L(G)$ of a graph $G(V,E)$ there exists an edge $e$ between $e_1\in E$ and $e_2\in E$ if the head of $e_1$ is incident
     * to the tail of $e_2$. To determine the weight of $e$ in $L(G)$, the weight function takes as input $e_1$ and $e_2$.
     *
     * <p>
     * Note: a special case arises when graph $G$ contains self-loops. Self-loops (as well as multiple edges) simply add
     * additional nodes to line graph $L(G)$. When $G$ is <em>directed</em>, a self-loop $e=(v,v)$ in $G$ results in a vertex
     * $e$ in $L(G)$, and in addition a self-loop $(e,e)$ in $L(G)$, since, by definition, the head of $e$ in $G$ is incident to
     * its own tail. When $G$ is <em>undirected</em>, a self-loop $e=(v,v)$ in $G$ results in a vertex $e$ in $L(G)$, but
     * <em>no</em> self-loop $(e,e)$ is added to $L(G)$, since, by convention, the line graph of an undirected graph is
     * commonly assumed to be a simple graph.
