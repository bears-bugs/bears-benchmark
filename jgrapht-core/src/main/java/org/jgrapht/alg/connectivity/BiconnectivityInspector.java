/**
 * Allows obtaining various connectivity aspects of a graph. The <i>inspected graph</i> is specified
 * at construction time and cannot be modified. No restrictions are imposed on the input graph.
 * Multigraphs and pseudographs are also supported. The inspector traverses connected components
 * (undirected graphs) or weakly connected components (directed graphs). To find strongly connected
 * components, use {@link KosarajuStrongConnectivityInspector} instead. This class offers an
 * alternative implementation of some of the functionality encountered in
 * {@link ConnectivityInspector}. It is likely to perform somewhat slower than
 * {@link ConnectivityInspector}, but offers more functionality in return.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm implemented in this class is Hopcroft and Tarjan's biconnected components
 * algorithm, described in: Hopcroft, J. Tarjan, R. Algorithm 447: efficient algorithms for graph
 * manipulation, 1973. Communications of the ACM. 16 (6): 372â€“378. This implementation runs in
 * linear time $O(|V|+|E|)$ and is based on a recursive depth-first search. More information about
 * this subject be be found in this wikipedia
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biconnected_component">article</a>.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The inspector methods work in a lazy fashion: no computations are performed unless immediately
 * necessary. Computation are done once and results are cached within this class for future need.
 * The core of this class is built around a recursive Depth-first search.
