/**
 * A Block-Cutpoint graph (also known as a block-cut tree). If $G$ is a graph, the block-cutpoint
 * graph of $G$, denoted $BC(G)$ is the simple bipartite graph with bipartition $(A, B)$ where $A$
 * is the set of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ArticulationVertex.html">cut-vertices</a>
 * (also known as articulation points) of $G$, and $B$ is the set of
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Block.html">blocks</a> of $G$. $BC(G)$ contains an edge
 * $(a,b)$ for $a \in A$ and $b \in B$ if and only if block $b$ contains the cut-vertex $a$. A
 * vertex in $G$ is a cut-vertex if removal of the vertex from $G$ (and all edges incident to this
 * vertex) increases the number of connected components in the graph. A block of $G$ is a maximal
 * connected subgraph $H \subseteq G$ so that $H$ does not have a cut-vertex. Note that if $H$ is a
 * block, then either $H$ is 2-connected, or $|V(H)| \leq 2$. Each pair of blocks of $G$ share at
 * most one vertex, and that vertex is a cut-point in $G$. $BC(G)$ is a tree in which each leaf node
 * corresponds to a block of $G$.
 * <p>
 * Note: the block-cutpoint graph is not changed when the underlying graph is changed.
