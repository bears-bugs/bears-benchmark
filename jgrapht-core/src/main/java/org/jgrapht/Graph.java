/**
 * The root interface in the graph hierarchy. A mathematical graph-theory graph object
 * <tt>G(V,E)</tt> contains a set <tt>V</tt> of vertices and a set <tt>
 * E</tt> of edges. Each edge e=(v1,v2) in E connects vertex v1 to vertex v2. for more information
 * about graphs and their related definitions see <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Graph.html</a>.

 * <p>
 * This library generally follows the terminology found at:
 * <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html">
 * http://mathworld.wolfram.com/topics/GraphTheory.html</a>. Implementation of this interface can
 * provide simple-graphs, multigraphs, pseudographs etc. The package <code>org.jgrapht.graph</code>
 * provides a gallery of abstract and concrete graph implementations.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This library works best when vertices represent arbitrary objects and edges represent the
 * relationships between them. Vertex and edge instances may be shared by more than one graph.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Through generics, a graph can be typed to specific classes for vertices <code>V</code> and edges
 * <code>E&lt;T&gt;</code>. Such a graph can contain vertices of type <code>V</code> and all
 * sub-types and Edges of type <code>
 * E</code> and all sub-types.
