/**
 * Watts-Strogatz small-world graph generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The generator is described in the paper: D. J. Watts and S. H. Strogatz. Collective dynamics of
 * small-world networks. Nature 393(6684):440--442, 1998.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The following paragraph from the paper describes the construction.
 * 
 * <p>
 * "The generator starts with a ring of $n$ vertices, each connected to its $k$ nearest neighbors
 * ($k$ must be even). Then it chooses a vertex and the edge that connects it to its nearest
 * neighbor in a clockwise sense. With probability $p$, it reconnects this edge to a vertex chosen
 * uniformly at random over the entire ring with duplicate edges forbidden; otherwise it leaves the
 * edge in place. The process is repeated by moving clock-wise around the ring, considering each
 * vertex in turn until one lap is completed. Next, it considers the edges that connect vertices to
 * their second-nearest neighbors clockwise. As before, it randomly rewires each of these edges with
 * probability $p$, and continues this process, circulating around the ring and proceeding outward
 * to more distant neighbors after each lap, until each edge in the original lattice has been
 * considered once. As there are $\frac{nk}{2}$ edges in the entire graph, the rewiring process
 * stops after $\frac{k}{2}$ laps. For $p = 0$, the original ring is unchanged; as $p$ increases,
 * the graph becomes increasingly disordered until for $p = 1$, all edges are rewired randomly. For
 * intermediate values of $p$, the graph is a small-world network: highly clustered like a regular
 * graph, yet with small characteristic path length, like a random graph."
 * 
 * <p>
 * The authors require $n \gg k \gg \ln(n) \gg 1$ and specifically $k \gg \ln(n)$ guarantees that a
 * random graph will be connected.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Through the constructor parameter the model can be slightly changed into adding shortcut edges
 * instead of re-wiring. This variation was proposed in the paper: M. E. J. Newman and D. J. Watts,
 * Renormalization group analysis of the small-world network model, Physics Letters A, 263, 341,
 * 1999.
