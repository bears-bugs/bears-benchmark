/**
 * The linearized chord diagram graph model generator.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The generator makes precise several unspecified mathematical details of the Barabási-Albert
 * model, such as the initial configuration of the first nodes, and whether the $m$ links assigned
 * to a new node are added one by one, or simultaneously, etc. The generator is described in the
 * paper: Bélaa Bollobás and Oliver Riordan. The Diameter of a Scale-Free Random Graph. Journal
 * Combinatorica, 24(1): 5--34, 2004.
 * 
 * <p>
 * In contrast with the Barabási-Albert model, the model of Bollobás and Riordan allows for multiple
 * edges (parallel-edges) and self-loops. They show, however, that their number will be small. This
 * means that this generator works only on graphs which allow multiple edges (parallel-edges) such
 * as {@link Pseudograph} or {@link DirectedPseudograph}.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The generator starts with a graph of one node and grows the network by adding $n-1$ additional
 * nodes. The additional nodes are added one by one and each of them is connected to $m$ previously
 * added nodes (or to itself with a small probability), where the probability of connecting to a
 * node is proportional to its degree.
