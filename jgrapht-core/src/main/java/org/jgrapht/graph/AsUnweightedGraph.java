/**
 * Provides an unweighted view on a graph.
 *
 * Algorithms designed for unweighted graphs should also work on weighted graphs. This class
 * emulates an unweighted graph based on a weighted one by returning <code>Graph.DEFAULT_EDGE_WEIGHT
 * </code> for each edge weight. The underlying weighted graph is provided at the constructor.
 * Modifying operations (adding/removing vertexes/edges) are also passed through to the underlying
 * weighted graph. As edge weight, Graph.DEFAULT_EDGE_WEIGHT is used. Setting an edge weight is not
 * supported. The edges are not modified. So, if an edge is asked for, the one from the underlying
 * weighted graph is returned. In case the underlying graph is serializable, this one is
 * serializable, too.
 *
 * @param <V> the graph vertex type
 * @param <E> the graph edge type
