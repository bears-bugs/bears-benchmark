# Corfu Bin Directory

This directory contains symlinks which execute the Corfu server
and various Corfu utilities. The symlinks execute scripts in the 
scripts directory, which take care of starting Java.

Most of these utilities are self documenting, run them with no arguments
for a description of what they do.
