EPSG Access Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *gt-epsg-access** plugin provides an Coordinate Reference System authority based on the Microsoft Access database. 

The EPSG database is distributed as a Microsoft Access database so this this is usually the most direct (and official) source you can get.

Please note that this module can be used on any platform, you will need to provide connection parameters to the access database to be used (which only runs on a windows box).
