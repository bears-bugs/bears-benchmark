[[screenshot-summary]]
== Summary
* Images should be saved as *PNG* or *JPG*, with a width of at least *660 px*, at *110 dpi*. Try to keep file size less than *300 KB*.
* Screenshots supplement the text, not replace it.  *Do not rely on images to provide information or context*.
* *Do not include any testing/pre-release labels*.
* *Do not include any personally identifying information*.
* Capture just the part of the screen or window that users must focus on; *do not include window headers in the final screenshots unless completely necessary*.
* Manipulate your screenshots to *condense important information* in them and limit empty GUI space and other inconsequential parts.

[[screenshot-general]]
== General Guidelines
* Screen captures can be useful and successful when they achieve one or more of these objectives:
** Illustrate a user interface that is fairly complex or difficult to explain in text
** Help the user find a small element in a complex user interface
** Show the results of a series of steps or user actions
** Orient readers who are reading the publication without the user interface in front of them
* Use the smallest number of screenshots possible.
* Use screenshots to provide verification for the reader, rather than instruction. For example, screenshots are meant to supplement the text, not replace it.  *Do not rely on images to provide information or context*. Instead, use them only to provide the reader with orientation.
+
NOTE: Example 1:  Do not tell the reader to fill out a form according to the image; instead list the values needed for the form in text.
+
NOTE: Example 2: Do not include an image of the directory tree; instead tell the user exactly where to find the file in running text (…​/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml).

* Bearing in mind the affect on localization and accessibility, aim to write your document so that, were you to remove all screenshots from the book, the text still makes sense.
+
NOTE: For example: Do not write "see image below" or "as is shown in the image"

* When you are snapping a GUI form, fill it with relevant input first.
* Verify that the screenshots *do not include any testing/pre-release labels*.
* Verifty that the screenshots *do not include any personally identifying information*.
+
NOTE: For example: Always use 'test' as the username or fake contact information. If including the browser title bar hide your bookmarks and use a default browser theme.

+
TIP: Use Chrome Dev Tools to select elements on the page and rewrite their contents.

* Include the cursor, mouse pointer, or menus only when their presence is significant.
* Increase font size in the browser if it is hard to read before snapping the image.
* Capture just the part of the screen or window that users must focus on.
+
NOTE: For example: Unless necessary, *do not include window headers in the final screenshots* to indicate your currently used window manager or desktop environment.

* If possible, try not to cut any elements on the screen.
* Show the user interface elements exactly as they are displayed for most users for quick recognition.
+
NOTE: For example: If you have a custom theme on your system, disable it and take the screenshot using the default theme.

* Do not add borders around or drop shadows to your screenshots.
* Do not use rounded corners. If the screenshot contains rounded corners, then that is acceptable. But, the screenshot should remain squared.

[[screenshot-specs]]
== Tech Specs
* Image width should be at least *660 px* (internal tools will automatically resize the image to a max width of 660 px).
* The preferred format is *PNG* or *JPG* .
* The output resolution of images should be *110 dpi* to ensure good quality in the generated PDF.
+
TIP: In GIMP, select *Image/Scale Image...* to set resolution

* If possible, try to keep screenshot size less than *300 KB*.
* If possible, avoid snapping images in various terminals with 8-bit color scale or less.
* Manipulate your screenshots to condense important information in them and limit empty GUI space and other inconsequential parts.
+
NOTE: You can do this by setting a low screen resolution or resizing your browser window to a smaller size. Remember that you should only do this if it does not adversely affect the readability of the image.
+
NOTE: If you need to take a screenshot of the entire window, use a tool such as the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en[_Window Resizer_^] Google Chrome extension to ensure the browser window is a set size before taking the screenshot. This helps ensure that all full window screenshots are of standard dimensions.

* If necessary, call attention to hard to find parts of the screenshot with red outlines (border: #C00, width:1px) or with a transparent gray (#ECECEC) layer over unimportant parts of the picture.

[[screenshot-accessibility]]
== Accessibility
* Section 508 compliance requires that all of the information is available in a text format for accessibility reasons (for instance, screen readers can not extract information from images).
* Also, a large number of screenshots can possibly slow download of docs for those on slow connections (rarer for most enterprises these days).

[[screenshot-asciidoc]]
== AsciiDoc Syntax
* Insert a block-level image, which uses a double colon (::). Good for screenshots, diagrams, etc.

** Example 1: Include an image title in title case (which automatically appends a Figure #).
+
----
.Image Title
image::icon.png[Alt text, 50, 50]
----

** Example 2: Insert an inline image. Note, there is only one colon (:) used here.
+
----
This is an inline image. image:icon.png[Alt text] Cool!
----

[[screenshot-questions]]
== Additional Questions
* When should I add a screenshot to my book?
** When  introducing a new part of the UI.
** When the UI is suboptimal and some elements are difficult to find, located in unusual places, hidden, or somehow less visible.
* When, in the development cycle, should I add my screenshots?
** Add them as late in the cycle as possible, preferably during the review process. At this late stage, hopefully there will be fewer UI changes to the product.
+
TIP: Add a placeholder for the screenshot early on in the development cycle. This way it will not be forgotten.

* What image editor should I use?
** The recommended graphical editor is GIMP.

[[screenshot-extensions]]
== Browser Extensions

[[screenshot-resizing]]
=== Resizing Screenshots
There are a couple simple browser extensions that can assist in resizing your browser to the appropriate dimensions.

* Google Chrome extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/window-resizer/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh?hl=en[_Window Resizer_^]
* Firefox add-on: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firesizer/[_Firesizer_^]
** You also need to install the Addon Bar: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-addon-bar/[_The Addon Bar (Restored)_^]
