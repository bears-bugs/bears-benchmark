.Additional General Guidelines
* Stick to one file per chapter unless the content is too long,
  excluding reusable topics.
* Don't use contractions, ;).
* Document IDs are book-scoped, so they don't need the book title in
  them.
* Terminate bulleted and numbered lists with periods unless the items
  listed are simple names.
* The words "server" and "broker" are not capitalized unless they
   begin a sentence or appear in a title.
* Avoid the word "simply" unless it clarifies.
* For substitution of `{attr}` in code blocks, use `[subs=+attributes]`.
* For styling of `++*bold*++` (`*bold*`) in code blocks, use
  `[subs=+quotes]`.
* Do not use the word 'the' before 'Broker'. It is just 'Broker'

=== Styling Headings and Titles

In headline-style capitalization, capitalize the initial letter of the following words:

* The first and last words of the text
* All nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions, such as 'after', 'although', 'because', 'before', 'how', 'if', 'than', 'that', 'though', 'until', 'when', 'where', 'whether', and 'while'
* Any word in a hyphenated compound that is not an article, preposition, or coordinating conjunction
* The last word in a hyphenated compound, regardless of its part of speech

In headline-style capitalization, do not capitalize the initial letter of the following words:

* Articles, except as the first word
* Coordinating conjunctions
* Prepositions, except as the first or last word
* The 'to' in an infinitive

NOTE: To learn more about Headline-style titles see, the _Capitalization_ section in Chapter 1 of the _IBM Style Guide_.

=== Styling Replaceables

.Replaceables Quick Reference
[cols="50%,50%a",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Use
|Replaceable value |\`\_SOME_VAR_`
|Location of broker instance |\`\_BROKER_INSTANCE_DIR_`
|Component install directory |\`\_INSTALL_DIR_`
|===

TIP: If using a replaceable within a source block, you will need to add
`subs="+quotes"`` to the source tag for it to render. (For example : `++[source,options="nowrap",subs="+quotes"]++`).

.Additional Replaceable Guidelines
* Use callouts for replaceables in code segments to make it clear to the user
  that a replaceable is present.

=== Styling Links

.Links Quick Reference
[cols="33%,33%a,33%a",options="header"]
|===
|Item |Use |Not
.2+|Zip files .2+|zip
|_.zip_
|ZIP
.2+|Tar files .2+|tar
|_.tar_
|TAR
|External links |\link:github.com[GitHub^] |\link:github.com[GitHub]
|Internal links |\xref:doc_id[Section Title]|\xref:doc_id[Section Title^]
|===

NOTE: If you use the caret syntax more than once in a single paragraph, you may need to
escape the first occurrence with a backslash.

IMPORTANT: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links)
are a feature unique to Asciidoctor. When they are enabled, you must surround the link text
in double quotes if it contains a comma.

.Additional Link Guidelines
* Refer to the top-level sections of books as chapters, not sections
  or topics.
* Do not split link paths across lines when wrapping text. This will cause issues with the doc builds.
