==== Connecting with AMQP

For sending and receiving messages, have a look at an example python
http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-0.18.0/proton/python/examples/simple_send.py.html[sender]
and
http://qpid.apache.org/releases/qpid-proton-0.18.0/proton/python/examples/simple_recv.py.html[receiver].

To send and receive messages, you should connect to the exposed route. To start a receiver, run:

[options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
....
./simple_recv.py -a "amqps://$({OcGetRoute} messaging):{OcRoutePort}/myanycast" -m 10
....

This will block until it has received 10 messages. To start the sender, run:

[options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
....
./simple_send.py -a "amqps://$({OcGetRoute} messaging):{OcRoutePort}/myanycast" -m 10
....

The server certificates is not verified in the above examples. To fetch the certificate, run:

[options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
....
mkdir -p certs
{occli} get secret external-certs-messaging -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d > certs/tls.crt
....

You can modify the client code to use this cert to verify the server connection.

Have a look at <<connecting>> for more client examples.
