==== Deploying {ProductName}

===== Using script

Invoke the deployment script to deploy {ProductName}

[options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
....
./deploy-{ClusterManager}.sh -m "https://{DeployHost}:8443" -n enmasse {DeployOptions}
....

===== Using ansible
[options="nowrap",subs=attributes+]
....
ansible-playbook ansible/playbooks/openshift/singletenant.yml
....


This will create the deployments required for running {ProductName}. Starting
up {ProductName} will take a while, usually depending on how fast it is able
to download the docker images for the various components. In the
meantime, you can start to create your address configuration.
