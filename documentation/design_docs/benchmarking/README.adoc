Benchmarking
------------

EnMasse provides a benchmarking suite, ebench, that can run alongside
the EnMasse cluster or on a separate set of machines. The suite is
composed of an agent that sends messages to a specific address and a
collector that aggregates metrics from multiple agents. To start an
agent and a collector, invoke the benchmark template:

....
oc process -f include/benchmark-template.json | oc create -f -
....

The agent and collector is parameterized using environment variables
defined in the specification file.

You can scale the number of agents by adjusting the number of replicas,
and the collector will automatically pick up the changes and display
aggregated results for all agents running.
