Address controller
------------------

The address controller is about more than controller addresses. The main
tasks performed by the address controller are:

* API server for managing address spaces and addresses (HTTP and AMQP)
* Implementation of Open Service Broker API for EnMasse
* Controller for taking action based on address spaces (create/destroy
enmasse infrastructure and managing routing + certs) etc.)
* Controller for taking action based on addresses (create/destroy
deployments for addresses pointing to flavors for brokers for instance)
