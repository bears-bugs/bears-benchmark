[[keep-alive]]
= Keep alive

The keep alive mechanism at MQTT side is handled by the FE, exchanging
_PINGREQ_ and _PINGRESP_ with the MQTT client.

The life of the corresponding AMQP client is handled by AMQP “empty”
message at connection level (as usual).

The FE uses the "keep alive timeout" parameter from the MQTT _CONNECT_
message for specifying the "idle-time-out" parameter om the AMQP open
connection operation.
