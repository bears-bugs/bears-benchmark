Recipe for setting up metrics and grafana

1.  Setup hawkular with OpenShift. For local deployment, doing
`oc cluster up --metrics` should be enough. For advanced install, see
https://docs.openshift.org/latest/install_config/cluster_metrics.html
2.  Make sure your user is setup with cluster-admin privileges (either
oc login -u system:admin or use oc --config )
3.  Select the openshift-infra project (using default is also OK, but I
usually deploy all the metrics stuff in openshift-infra)
4.  Deploy hawkular-openshift-agent for collecting metrics from EnMasse.
Follow the instructions at
https://github.com/openshift/origin-metrics#deploying-the-hawkular-openshift-agent
(NOTE: When processing the hawkular-openshift-agent template, set
IMAGE_VERSION=1.4.0.Final to ensure that it doesn't crash when handling
mbean wildcards)
5.  Deploy EnMasse to desired project/namespace
6.  Deploy the hawkular-grafana using one of these templates:
https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-grafana-datasource/tree/master/docker/openshift
. This will build the whole thing from source, so takes a while
7.  When the hawkular-grafana deployment is done, a route has been
created (oc get route -n openshift-infra to list). Go to the exposed
route, login (admin/admin)
8.  Setup a new data source with type hawkular (host found in the
openshift-infra project, I had to use the service ip from 'oc get
service hawkular-metrics -n openshift-infra' since it was unable to
resolve the metrics route host), and configure it with tenant: and
password: (oc whoami -t)
9.  You can now create dashboards and select metrics coming from
brokers. An example dashboard can be found here:
