== Prerequisites

To install {ProductName}, you need to have the OpenShift client tools. You can download the OpenShift
Origin client from https://github.com/openshift/origin/releases[OpenShift Origin]. {ProductName} has
been tested to work with the latest stable release of the OpenShift Origin Client.

If you do not have an OpenShift cluster available, see
https://github.com/minishift/minishift[minishift] for an example of how to run a local instance of OpenShift
on your machine.

You also need a way to generate certificates. This guide uses https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL].
