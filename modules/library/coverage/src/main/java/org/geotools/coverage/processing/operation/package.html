  <BODY>
    List of coverage {@linkplain org.geotools.coverage.processing.AbstractOperation operations}.
    This package is useful for documentation purpose since class names match exactly operation
    names, and the javadoc for each class provides a table of valid arguments. But the classes
    provided there should not be used directly. There is no need to instantiate them, since it
    is already done by the {@linkplain org.geotools.coverage.processing.DefaultProcessor processor}
    which manage them.
