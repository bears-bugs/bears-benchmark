  <BODY>
    A set of <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jai/">Java Advanced Imaging</A>
    operations. All operations defined here work on J2SE's {@linkplain java.awt.image.RenderedImage
    rendered images}; there is no OpenGIS's {@linkplain org.opengis.coverage.grid.GridCoverage
    grid coverage} depencencies here.

    <P ALIGN="justify">The JAI operations provided in this package should be registered automatically at
    JAI startup time, since they are declared in the {@code META-INF/registryFile.jai} file. However, this
    default JAI mechanism may fail in some occasions, for example when the Geotools JAR file is unreachable
    from the JAI class loader. In such case, the {@link org.geotools.image.jai.Registry#registerGeotoolsServices
    registerGeotoolsServices} method may be invoked programmatically as a fallback. This is done automatically
    by the {@link org.geotools.coverage.processing} package; users need to care only if they want to use directly
    the custom JAI operations provided in this package.</P>
