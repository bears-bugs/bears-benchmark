  {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.aggregate.Aggregate Aggregations} of geometric objects.
  The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-101.pdf">Feature Geometry (Topic 1)</A> specification.

  <P ALIGN="justify">Arbitrary aggregations of geometric objects are possible. These are not
  assumed to have any additional internal structure and are used to "collect" pieces of geometry
  of a specified type. In this respect they differ from "composites" and "complexes". Operations
  on these aggregations shall be the accumulators that are derived from the class operations of
  their elements. Applications may use aggregates for features that use multiple geometric objects
  in their representations, such as a collection of points to represent a tank farm or orchard.</P>
