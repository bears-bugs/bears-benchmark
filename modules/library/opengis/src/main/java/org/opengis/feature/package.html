    Representation a {@linkplain org.opengis.feature.Feature features} on a map. A
    {{Feature}} may represent a single item or a {{FeatureCollection}} of many things.
    Features with common properties may be categorised into a {{FeatureType}}, forming
    a dynamic type system similar to those introduced into other aspects of computer
    science.
    <p>
    The contents of this package form a feature model in accordance with the ideas
    expressed in the ISO 19107, as captured in the OGC Reference Model,
    GML3 and related specifications.   
    <ul>
    <li><a href="">ISO 19107</a> - link needed    
    <li><a href="">GML3</a> - link needed    
    <li><a href="">GML2</a> - link needed
    </ul>

    <H2>Type Model</H2>

    As mentioned above Features can make use of a FeatureType in order to describe the set
    of attributes, associations and operations they are expected to have.
    <p>
    A FeatureType represents this information in PropertyDescriptors as follows:
    <ul>
    <li>AttributeDescriptor - defines the name of the attribute and its AttributeType
    <li>AssociationDescriptor - defines the name of the association and its AssociationType
    <li>OperationDescriptor - defines the name of the operation and its OperationType
    </ul>
    This information is often considered "metadata" in the same manner as a Class is the
    metadata describing a Java Object.
    
    <h4>Naming</h4>
    
    One of the subjects that comes up when talking about metadata is "what the names mean",
    the names recorded by the PropertyDescriptors may be of some significance to the problem
    or domain being represented.
    <p>    
    You can represent this significance by making a "dictionary" of your names, in rare
    cases you can find a formal dictionary defined by an organisation. The idea of group
    names into a dictionary is represented by the concept of a "Namespace".
    
    A "Namespace" used to organise the names of your FeatureTypes is called a "Schema".
    
    Please note that "Schema" and "Namespace" above are strictly referring to spatial data.
    This gets especially confusing when working with spatial data in a web application -
    since the w3c XML technologies use similar language to describe their ideas.
    
    <H2>Data Model</H2>
    
    The data model is the subject of this package, and centred around the idea of a Feature, it
    forms a part of a larger picture and constructs defined here will be referenced from several
    other packages.

	<h4>Feature</h4>
	
	A Feature represents something that can be drawn onto a map. A feature acts as a model of
	a real world entity. As such it has many similarities to object oriented programming ideas
	of Class, Object, Field and Method.
	<ul>
	<li>Feature - runtime data structure (similar in use to Object)
	<li>Attributes - feature property that holds information about a Feature (similar to a Field)
	<li>Associations - feature property defining a relationships a Feature is involved in (similar to a reference or collection)
	<li>Operations - feature property describing functionality a feature is able to perform (similar to a Method)
	</ul>
	The most useful aspect of a Feature is the fact that it is a dynamic data construct defined
	at runtime.
	<p>
	Traditionally the Java programming language represents dynamic data structures using java.util.Map,
	you could think of a Feature as a java.util.Map in which the keys (ie attribute descriptors)
	are well defined.
	<p>
	If two Features have the same set of keys they are considered to be of the same FeatureType. A
	FeatureType is simply a list of valid attribute descriptors. You have the same kind of ability
	to represent your model with FeatureType as your do with Java class, inheritance is supported
	(ie superType) as is aggregation (your attributes can be Features).
	
	<h4>Record</h4>
	
	A Record is a simple data structure (it really is exactly the same as a Map with well known
	keys). Once again two Records with the same set of keys are considered to belong to the same
	RecordType.
	<p>
	Records are most often used as the result of an Operation. For the a Coverage (which is a kind
	of Feature) a operation is defined to "sample" a specific location, the information returned
	as part of this sample is a Record.
	
	<h4>SimpleFeature</h4>
	
	The idea of a simple feature is a concept introduced within the context of the GeoAPI project, many of
	the Java projects we work with are interested in a more approachable model similar in spirit
	to an array of ordered values, or at most a java.util.Map of named values.
	<p>
	A Simple feature is a Feature with the following additional requirements:
	<ul>
	<li>Attributes always must occur in the same order defined in their FeatureType
	<li>Ideas such as inheritance and aggregation are left out of it
	<li>Duplicate values are not allowed
	</ul>
	These restrictions enable us to produce an API that is far easier to work with, values
	can be accessed by name, or by order and so on.
	<p>
	There is evidence that this need is present in other contexts, GML 3 has been simplified to a
	"Simple Feature" profile operating with similar restrictions to the ones indicated above.
		
    <H2>Query Model</H2>

    <H4>Filter</H4>
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">Our {{@linkplain org.opengis.filter.Filter filter}} constructs are
    used to partition values into sets. We have deliberately defined Filter to work on more than
    just Feature instances, allowing us to use these ideas to capture restrictions on individual
    attribute values.
    
    Filter should be viewed as our query or constraint system.
    
    <H4>Identity</H4>
    
    <p>Closely related to the concept of constraints is one of identity, it is difficult to think
    of identification as a topic apart from the definition of a feature as a representation of a
    real world entity. In actual fact identity is related to the the definition of a Filter, a name
    is just another way of separating out a partition of values, the set in this case happens to be
    a set of one.
    
    <P ALIGN="justify">The concept of Identity is a troublesome one, our model supports the concept
    of "feature id". In the General OGC reference model the identification of a feature is intended
    to be unqiue and specific to the real world entity being modeled (regardless of the particular
    set of attribute you are using to describe in the current context).
        <p>
    
    As an example you may wish to model a roadway with pavement type and history of repair when looking
    at a budget for the coming year, the same road may be modelled in the future with a collection of
    possible routes when planning for over a ten year period. The "road" should be the same in both
    situations, and have the same id.
        <p>
    
    It is very difficult to be diligent with the concept of ID, GML3 for example only restricts an
    ID to be unique within the scope of a single document. I would suggestion you chose a stable
    source of identification, in the example above it would facilitate "joining" both datasets to
    predict repair costs for each of the proposed routes.
