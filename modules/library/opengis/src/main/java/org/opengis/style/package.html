  <h2>The following package is an implementation of OGC Symbology Encoding 1.1.0 and ISO 19117 : Portrayal</h2>
  This package is a merge from package GeoAPI SLD (v1.0.0) and GeoTools styling.<br>
  
  <h2>Symbology Encoding overview</h2>

  <p>This document defines an XML encoding that can be used for styling feature and
  coverage data.<br>
  Symbology Encoding includes the FeatureTypeStyle as root element.
  These elements include all information for styling the data such as Filter and different
  kinds of Symbolizers.<br>
  As Symbology Encoding is a grammar for styling map data independent of any service
  interface specification it can be used flexibly by a number of services that style
  georeferenced information or store styling information that can be used by other services.
  </p>
  
  
  <P ALIGN="justify">Symbology Encoding is a specification that define styles in xml files.
  This GeoAPI implementation may be a bit different from the original XSD structure to offer
  a better integration in the Java langage and to follow ISO 19117.</P>
  
  <h2>Here are schemas breafly describing the java implementation :</h2>
  <br>
      - Styles have N rules, and each rule have N Symbolizers.<br>
