  Set of geometric objects that are not decomposed further into
  other {@linkplain org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Primitive primitives}.
  The following is adapted from
  <A HREF="http://www.opengis.org/docs/01-101.pdf">Feature Geometry (Topic 1)</A> specification.

  <P ALIGN="justify">The Geometric primitive package contains all the geometric primitives
  and supporting data types used in describing their boundaries. A geometric primitive is a
  geometric object that is not decomposed further into other primitives in the system. This
  includes curves and surfaces, even though they are composed of curve segments and surface
  patches, respectively. Those curve segments and surface patches cannot exist outside the
  context of a primitive.</P>

  <BLOCKQUOTE><P ALIGN="justify"><FONT SIZE=2><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Most geometric primitives are
  decomposable infinitely many times. Adding a centre point to a line may split that line into two
  separate lines. A new curve drawn across a surface may divide that surface into two parts, each
  of which is a surface. This is the reason that the normal definition of primitive as
  "non-decomposable" is not plausible in a geometry model - the only non-decomposable object in
  geometry is a point.</FONT></P></BLOCKQUOTE>
 
  <P ALIGN="justify">Any geometric object that is used to describe a feature is a collection of
  geometric primitives. A collection of geometric primitives may or may not be a geometric complex.
  Geometric complexes have additional properties such as closure by boundary operations and mutually
  exclusive component parts. {@link org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Primitive} and
  {@link org.opengis.geometry.complex.Complex} share most semantics, in the meaning of operations and
  attributes. There is an exception in that a {@link org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Primitive} shall not
  contain its boundary (except in the trivial case of {@link org.opengis.geometry.primitive.Point} where
  the boundary is empty), while a {@link org.opengis.geometry.complex.Complex} shall contain its boundary
  in all cases.</P>
