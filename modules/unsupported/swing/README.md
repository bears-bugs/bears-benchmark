# Swing Widgets

Provides dialog box, status bar, etc. using Swing framework. Some widgets
like `OperationTreeBrowser` are useful for debugging.

## Status

The `widgets-swing` extension is stable. However it contains a
`FeatureTableModel` class which is not really supported, since the
feature models are changing and I don't know if the original author plan
to update his class. The remaining of this package is supported.

* :star: Passes IP check, see [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md]
* :star: Releasable - no blocking bugs in jira, included in geotools release
* :warning: Quality Assurance - as a set of widgets test case coverage is low
* :star: API is stable
* :star: Supported - user docs provided

## Future development

Some classes may be added from time to time according to suggestions on the user-list
