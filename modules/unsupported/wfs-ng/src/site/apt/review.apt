  Adrian,

  Your asessment is correct, there is a mixture of paid and unpaid effort. There 
  are changes  within the WFS plugin which should have shared copyrights; 
  however without spending a bunch of effort I cant' track down the exact 
  changes. The simplest method would be to look for SVN commits using my userid 
  after March 31st 2005.

  Regards,
  David Zwiers
  
  Performing an SVN log on all the java files of the module gave us these 
  files to modify:
  
      src/test/java/org/geotools/wfs/v_1_0_0/data/CubewerksOnlineTest.java
      
      src/test/java/org/geotools/wfs/v_1_0_0/data/WFSDataStoreReadTest.java
      
      src/test/java/org/geotools/wfs/v_1_0_0/data/GeoServerOnlineTest.java

      src/main/java/org/geotools/data/ows/WFSCapabilities.java
      
  All have been updated according to the dates of David's commits as his 
  copyright for 2005 only or for both 2005 and 2006.
  
  
  For future reference, we have David's permission to change to GPL+CLASSPATH 
  some day, if we choose to do so:

    Re-licensing as GPL+CLASSPATH is fine with me. That said, I don't believe 
    you require explicit permission to create a release with a more restrictive 
    license ... but it may be hard to change the license for any previosuly 
    released code.
