# These tests are loading invalid polygons (intersect themselves) which return errors.  Normally
# JTS doesn't check the validity of geometries as they are being made, but this spec DOES
# the validity, so these tests are bogus and should be skipped.
# (these desc names are too long or invalid somehow and aren't being picked up by the
# test parser, so I have commented them out in the actual XML file for now).
