# the following tests create invalid polygons which normally don't cause JTS to error out, 
# but because these specs force the validity check of geometries as they are made, it errors
# out here.  
# (these desc names are too long or invalid somehow and aren't being picked up by the
# test parser, so I have commented them out in the actual XML file for now).
