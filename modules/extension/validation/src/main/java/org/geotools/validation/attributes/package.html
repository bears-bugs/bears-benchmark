Simple Attribute based Validation implementations.
<p>
This package is used to store simple Attribute based
Validation implementations. Many of these will be simple 
FeatureValidation implementations concerned with enforcing
constraints on the attributes of a Feture.
</p>
<p>
At least a couple IntegrityValidation tests will also be implemented here
performing such opperations as ensuring that an attribute is unique
for an entire FeatureType.
