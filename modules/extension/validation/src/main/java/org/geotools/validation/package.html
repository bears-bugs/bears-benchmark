Defines the Validation Processor and Support classes.
<p>
The Validation Process is defined separately from GeoServer so that
it may be reused in the future by other applications.
</p>
<p>
It is currently lurking in the geotools2 folder in the hopes that when
it is finished it may be migrated to the Geotools2 library.
</p>
<p>
This work has been donated by Refractions Research as part of
a GeoConnections funded Validating Web Feature Server project.
