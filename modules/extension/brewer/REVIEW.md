## Initial Review

 - Jody Garnett, July 8th, 2006

 - Adrian Custer, June 2008

James and Cory listed as developers, no module maintainer!

This is a tough case as this module includes the results of research
done at Penn State University (by a collegue of James Macgill). While
the work has been made available by C. Brewer, I wonder if it inclusion
in a library is cause to comment.

IP Issues:

 - (removed) There is a dummy LICENSE.txt file in the module folder...

 - (done) Need to add ColorBrewer (TM) license

```
org.geotools.brewer.color
```

Added in geotools 2.2 for use in uDig theme generation.


```
org.geotools.brewer.color.resources
```
