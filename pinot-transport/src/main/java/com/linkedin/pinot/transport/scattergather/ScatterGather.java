   * Async Scatter-Gather request.

   * If one of the request is to the server which is running this code, then the

   * will be called in a separate thread.
   *
   *  Here are the steps:
   *
   * 1. Selection-strategy is applied to pick one service for each partition-group (PARTITION_GROUP granularity) or
   *    partition (PARTITION granularity).
   * 2. If more than one partitions selects a service, the requests are merged so that there is one request per
   *    service to be queried.
   * 2. Async dispatch of request to each service and track each futures
   * 3. Return an aggregate future that encapsulate individual futures.
   *
   * @param scatterGatherRequest scatter-gather request.
   * @param scatterGatherStats scatter-gather statistics.
   * @param isOfflineTable whether the scatter-gather target is an OFFLINE table.
   * @param brokerMetrics broker metrics to track execution statistics.
   * @return future containing response from all services queried.
