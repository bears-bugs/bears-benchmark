<p>The Cyclomatic Complexity is measured by the number of
  (&amp;&amp;, ||) operators and (if, while, do-while, for, ?:, catch,
   case, default) statements in the source file plus one for each function.</p>
<p>
	Even when the Cyclomatic Complexity of a file (class) is very high, this
	complexity might be well distributed among all functions. Nevertheless,
	most of the time, a very complex file is a file which breaks the <a

		Responsibility Principle</a> and which should be re-factored to be split
	in several files (classes).
