    //@// An EncryptedDataKey object abstractly contains 3 pieces of data.

    //@ model public instance byte[] providerId;
    //@ model public instance byte[] providerInformation;
    //@ model public instance byte[] encryptedDataKey;
    
    //@// The fields of an EncryptedDataKey may be populated via deserialization. The
    //@// Encryption SDK design allows the deserialization routine to be called repeatedly,
    //@// each call trying to fill in information that for some reason was not possible
    //@// with the previous call. In some such "intermediate" states, the deserialization
    //@// is incomplete in a way that other methods don't expect. Therefore, those methods
    //@// should not be called in these incomplete intermediate states. The model field
    //@// isDeserializing is true in those incomplete intermediate states, and it is used
    //@// in method specifications.
    //@ public model instance boolean isDeserializing;

    //@// There are some complications surrounding the representations of strings versus
    //@// byte arrays. The serialized form in message headers is always a sequence of
    //@// bytes, but the EncryptedDataKey interface (and some other methods)
    //@// expose the provider ID as if it were a string. Conversions (using UTF-8)
    //@// between byte arrays and strings (which in Java use UTF-16) are not bijections.
    //@// For example, both "\u003f".getBytes() and "\ud800".getBytes() yield a 1-byte
    //@// array containing [0x3f], and calling `new String(..., StandardCharsets.UTF_8)`
    //@// with either the 1-byte array [0x80] or the 3-byte array [0xef,0xbf,0xbd] yields
    //@// the string "\ufffd". Therefore, all we can say about these conversions
    //@// is that a given byte[]-String pair satisfies a conversion relation.
    //@//
    //@// The model functions "ba2s" and "s2ba" are used to specify the conversions

    //@// copies of their bodies that appear in the code. This is a limitation of JML.
    //@//
    //@// One of the properties that holds of "s2ba(s)" is that its result depends not
    //@// on the particular String reference "s" being passed in, but only the contents
    //@// of the string referenced by "s". This property is captured in the following

    //@// As a specification convenience, the model function "ba2s2ba" uses the two
    //@// model functions above to convert from a byte array to a String and then back
    //@// to a byte array. As mentioned above, this does not always result in a byte
    //@// array with the original contents. The "assume" statements about the conversion
    //@// functions need to be careful not to assume too much.
