/**
 * Represents a generic cache for cryptographic materials. MaterialsCaches store mappings from abstract bytestring
 * identifiers to MaterialsResults and DecryptResults.
 *
 * In general, the materials cache is concerned about the proper storage of these materials, and managing size limits
 * on the cache. While it stores statistics about cache usage limits, the enforcement of these limits is left to the
 * caller (typically, a {@link CachingCryptoMaterialsManager}).
 *
 * For encrypt, a cache implementation may store multiple cache entries for the same identifier. This allows for usage
 * limits to be enforced even when doing multiple streaming requests in parallel. However, the cache is permitted to
 * set a limit on the number of such entries (even as low as only allowing one entry per identifier), and if it does so
 * should evict the excess entries.
 *
 * Being a cache, a CryptoMaterialsCache is permitted to evict entries at any time. However, a caller can explicitly hint
 * the cache to invalidate an entry in the encrypt-side cache. This is generally done when usage limits are exceeded.
 * The cache is not required to respect this invalidation hint.
 *
 * Likewise, the CacheHint passed to the put calls on caches will indicate the maximum lifetime of entries; the cache
 * is allowed - but not required - to evict entries automatically upon expiration of this lifetime.
