/**
 * Internal classes for composing CSV text as output.
 * <p>
 * The {@link org.jsapar.compose.csv.CsvComposer} is the class that composes {@link org.jsapar.model.Document} or {@link org.jsapar.model.Line} into
 * Java Beans. Usually you don't use this class or any other class in this package directly. Instead you should use the
 * {@link org.jsapar.TextComposer} class as base for all type of text composing.
