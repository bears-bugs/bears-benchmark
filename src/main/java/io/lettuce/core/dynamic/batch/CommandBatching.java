/**
 * Programmatic command batching API.
 * <p>
 * {@link CommandBatching} is used to queue commands in a batch queue and flush the command queue on command invocation. Usage:
 *
 * <pre class="code">
 * public interface MyCommands extends Commands {
 *
 *   public void set(String key, String value, CommandBatching batching);
 *
 *   public RedisFuture&lt;String&gt; get(String key, CommandBatching batching)
 * }
 *
 * MyCommands commands = â€¦
 *
 * commands.set("key", "value", CommandBatching.queue());
 * commands.get("key", CommandBatching.flush());
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Using {@link CommandBatching} in a method signature turns the command method into a batched command method.<br/>
 * Command batching executes commands in a deferred nature. This also means that at the time of invocation no result is
 * available. Batching can be only used with synchronous methods without a return value ({@code void}) or asynchronous methods
 * returning a {@link io.lettuce.core.RedisFuture}. Reactive command batching is not supported because reactive executed
 * commands maintain an own subscription lifecycle that is decoupled from command method batching.
 * <p>
