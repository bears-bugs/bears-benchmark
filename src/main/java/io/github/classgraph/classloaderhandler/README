This directory contains ClassLoaderHandlers: classes that know how to extract classpath entries from ClassLoaders.

Note that URLClassLoader subclasses do not need a custom ClassLoaderHandler (unless they need to override the
delegation order, as with SpringBootRestartClassLoaderHandler), URLClassLoader subclasses are handled automatically
by ClassGraph.

If a new default ClassLoaderHandler is added to ClassGraph, then it should be added to ClassLoaderHandlerRegistry.
