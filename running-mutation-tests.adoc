= How to run mutation tests

The Tamaya Core and API projects support
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing[mutation testing^] by
the integration of http://pitest.org/quickstart/maven/[PIT^]
to validate the quality and effectivness of our tests.

== Running PIT

PIT is not part of the normal build process of Tamaya. Therefore it must
be executed manually with the following command.

[source]
----
$ mvn -P coverage 
----

The measurement of the coverage is faster if there is an existing
database created by PIT. To used them execute the following command.

[source]
----
$ mvn -P coverage -DwithHistory
