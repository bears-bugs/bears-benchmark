### Stress test for stress_zipkin2.service_span_index table
###
### Stress testing is done using the `cassandra-stress` tool
###
### For example
###  cqlsh -f zipkin2-test-schema.cql
###  cassandra-stress  user profile=span_by_service-stress.yaml ops\(insert=1\) no-warmup duration=1m  -rate threads=4 throttle=50/s
###
### after a benchmark has been run with only writes, a mixed read-write benchmark can be run with
###  cassandra-stress  user profile=span_by_service-stress.yaml ops\(insert=1,select=1,select_spans=1\)  duration=1m  -rate threads=4 throttle=50/s
