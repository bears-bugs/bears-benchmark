This package provides functionality to simulate different road-pricing scenarios in MATSim. It provides support for different toll schemes, for example distance tolls, cordon tolls and area tolls. The toll schemes are described in special XML files (see below). All supported toll schemes can be limited to a part of the network and can be time-dependent (that means that the amount agents have to pay for the toll can differ during the simulated day). 
The specified toll amount should be in respect to the scoring function used. Typically, the scoring function contains a parameter that defines the marginal utility of money; that parameter is used to convert toll amounts into utilities.
