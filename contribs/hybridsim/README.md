## Build information

Building this contribution with IntelliJ or maven in the command line works out of the box. 

### eclipse

Eclipse users, however, need to invoke 
	
	mvn eclipse:eclipse

before eclipse is able to compile it. This step needs to be repeated after every ``git pull''.

See the protobuf README.md for a bit more info.
