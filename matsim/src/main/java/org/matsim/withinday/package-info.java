/**
 * This package contains some experimental code which adds within day replanning features to the
 * QSim. The JDEQSim is not supported at the moment and currently there no plans to change that
 * (if you think you *really* need that, feel free to implement it...).
 * </p>
 * A tutorial which shows the usage of this code should be available by the end of 2011.
 * </p>
 * If you want to use this code, feel free to contact Christoph Dobler.
 * </p>
 * An alternative approach to within-day replanning can be found under tutorial.unsupported.example60WithinDayReplanningAgents (note added
 * by Kai Nagel in nov'12).
