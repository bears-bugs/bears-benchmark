/**
 * This package provides basic functionality to generate simple charts.
 * The amount of possible customization on the charts is very limited in favor
 * of a simple usage. If more elaborate charts are needed, they have to be
 * implemented on their own, making full use of JFreeChart or another charting
 * library. The classes in this package can be a starting point for custom,
 * more complex charts.
 * <p>
 * See {@link Demo} for examples on how to use the classes in this package.
