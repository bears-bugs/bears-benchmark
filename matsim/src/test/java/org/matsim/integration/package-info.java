/**
 * Contains integration tests for MATSim. While unit tests should test
 * functionality in as small pieces as possible ("units"; typically only
 * single methods, sometimes maybe more complex functionality of a class or,
 * in very rare circumstances of a package), integration tests verify that the
 * combination of multiple classes from different packages generate the
 * expected results.<br>
 *
 * Integration tests should be run after the unit tests, because failing units
 * will most likely lead to the failure of integrations.
