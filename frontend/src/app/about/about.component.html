                H2MS is an application for keeping track of compliance activities
                in clinical environments, initially aimed at providing a low-cost
                solution to improve hand-hygiene compliance auditing in clinical
                settings, and ultimately to significantly reduce the prevalence
                of infections spread by hand-contacts. Hand hygiene monitoring
                can be performed through a human observer using web-form on mobile
                device, as well as automated recording through inexpensive microcontroller
                devices using RFID or Bluetooth tags on hospital personnel.
                In addition, the web-form can be easily modified by the administrator
                of the H2MS to adapt to other monitoring tasks, such as glove and
                mask compliance. Clinical staff can obtain feedback on their compliance
                rating for individual improvement, and compliance officers use the collected
                information to devise organizational improvement strategies. The system
                is open-source, and can be modified to individual organizationâ€™s unique needs.
