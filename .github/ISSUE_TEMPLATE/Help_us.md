Help support Lettuce!

Lettuce has always been a community project, not really backed or owned by any single (or group) of companies. While some maintainers used to work at companies supporting open source no one was working on it full time and there certainly isn't a huge company or team anywhere doing all this work.

As a group of volunteers you can help us in a few ways

- Giving developer time on the project. (Message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LettuceDriver) or [Gitter](https://gitter.im/lettuce-io/Lobby) for guidance). Companies should be paying their employees to contribute back to the open source projects they use everyday.
