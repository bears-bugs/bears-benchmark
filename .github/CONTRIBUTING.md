# Contributing to Lettuce

## Quickstart
 
 For the impatient, if you want to submit a quick pull request:

* Make sure there is a ticket in GitHub issues.
* Make sure you use the code formatters provided here and have them applied to your changes. Don’t submit any formatting related changes.
* Make sure you submit test cases (unit or integration tests) that back your changes.
* Try to reuse existing test sample code (domain classes). Try not to amend existing test cases but create new ones dedicated to the changes you’re making to the codebase. Try to test as locally as possible but potentially also add integration tests.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.
Formatting settings are provided for Eclipse in https://github.com/lettuce-io/lettuce-core/blob/master/formatting.xml

## Bugreports

If you report a bug, please ensure to specify the following:

* Check GitHub issues whether someone else already filed a ticket. If not, then feel free to create another one.
* Comments on closed tickets are typically a bad idea as there's little attention on closed tickets. Please create a new one.
* Lettuce version (e.g. 3.2.Final)
* Contextual information (what were you trying to do using Lettuce)
* Simplest possible steps to reproduce
   * JUnit tests to reproduce are great but not obligatory

## Features

If you want to request a feature, please ensure to specify the following:

* What do you want to achieve?
* Contextual information (what were you trying to do using Lettuce).
* Ideally, but not required: Describe your idea how you would implement it.
