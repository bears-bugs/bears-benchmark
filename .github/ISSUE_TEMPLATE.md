We appreciate issues as very valuable contributions, but just to make sure here are things that are important to do before filing an issue:

* Only report issues, and ask Usage Questions on [Jackson-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!search/jackson-users) list -- ypu are more likely to get help that way
* Check to see if this issue has already been reported (quick glance at existing issues): no deep search necessary, just quick sanity check
* Include version information for Jackson version you use
* (optional but highly recommended) Verify that the problem occurs with the latest patch of same minor version; and even better, if possible, try using the latest stable patch version
