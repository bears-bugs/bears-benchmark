What kind of issue is this?

 - [ ] Question. This issue tracker is not the place for questions. If you want to ask how to do
       something, or to understand why something isn't working the way you expect it to, use Gitter
       or Stack Overflow. https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/zipkin

 - [ ] Bug report. If you’ve found a bug, spend the time to write a failing test. Bugs with tests
       get fixed and stay fixed. If you have a solution in mind, skip raising an issue and open a
       pull request instead.

 - [ ] Feature Request. First, look at existing issues to see if the feature has been requested
       before. If you don't find anything, tell us what problem you’re trying to solve. Often a
       solution already exists! Don’t send pull requests to implement new features without first
       getting our support. Sometimes we leave features out on purpose to keep the project small.
